      <abstract>We devised a “random‐clearing model” to predict effects of habitat
                loss on plant communities and populations. The model yields the probability that a
                species will be extirpated by land clearing, based on only two parameters: its
                density and the percentage of the landscape that has been cleared. It can also be
                used to predict species richness of plant communities following clearing, so long as
                densities of individual species are known. We tested the model using data on the
                distributions of 200 tree species (≥10 cm dbh) within two 9‐ha experimental
                landscapes in central Amazonia. Deforestation levels ranging from 20% to 99% of the
                landscape were simulated randomly, with the actual persistence of each species being
                the number of times it remained in the landscape after 1000 runs. The model was
                effective in all cases, explaining 83–99% of the total variability in species
                persistence on each plot. Species’ distribution patterns explained some residual
                variation in persistence but were of negligible importance compared to the
                predictions of the model. We also used the model to predict species richness,
                simulating both random and realistically contagious patterns of deforestation.
                Again, the model was highly effective, explaining 96% to 98% of the total variation
                in richness. Surprisingly, there was little difference in richness between random
                and contagious clearing patterns. These results suggest that, at least at the
                limited spatial scale of our analysis, the effects of deforestation on plant
                persistence and richness can be predicted using a simple model that assumes random
                species distributions and deforestation patterns. The model makes four predictions:
                (1) Density has an overriding influence on the susceptibility of species to
                clearing, while distribution patterns are usually of much lesser importance. (2) The
                relationship between density and persistence is nonlinear. (3) Rare species (≤1
                tree/ha) become exceptionally vulnerable in heavily degraded landscapes and in small
                forest remnants. (4) The distinction between high (e.g., 95%) and very high (e.g.,
                99%) levels of habitat clearing in terms of species persistence is often
                dramatic.</abstract>
