      <abstract>Spatial patterns can reveal a lot about ecological processes, but our
                knowledge of the spatial ecology of tree regeneration at a fine scale is quite
                limited. Therefore, we studied the spatial patterns of living and dead small trees
                in two subalpine Norway spruce forest reserves in Switzerland (Scatlè and
                Bödmerenwald) using three types of analyses. First, we investigated the distances of
                small trees to the nearest large neighboring tree and, by using maximum distances as
                indicator, inferred the size of forest gaps, detecting mainly forest gaps of small
                size, although with two exceptions that were driven by large-scale disturbances.
                Second, we accounted for spatial inhomogeneity in the pattern of small and large
                trees (i.e., variations in local tree densities) by including environmental
                covariates in point pattern models. Latitude (within the forest reserve), elevation
                and aspect contributed significantly to explaining the density of living and dead
                small trees, and partly of living and dead large trees. Yet, the influence of these
                environmental covariates varied between the two reserves due to their different
                topography and peculiar site conditions. Third, we analyzed neighborhood
                interactions between small and large trees based on the vicinity and size of trees.
                In both forest reserves, small living trees were randomly dispersed around large
                dead trees over a broad range of distances and, at certain distances in one reserve,
                even dispersed away from them. Small living trees further showed clustering around
                large living trees at short distances and dispersion at large distances. Small dead
                trees featured mainly a random pattern, although with a tendency to cluster around
                large neighbors at short distances, irrespective whether these were living or dead.
                Yet, the weakening of clustering with increasing distances indicates that the
                influence of large trees on small trees varies with spatial scale and thus that
                these neighborhood interactions are scale-dependent. Overall, our study contributes
                to a better understanding of the spatial ecology of mortality in small trees and
                ultimately of tree regeneration processes and stand dynamics in mountain
                forests.</abstract>
