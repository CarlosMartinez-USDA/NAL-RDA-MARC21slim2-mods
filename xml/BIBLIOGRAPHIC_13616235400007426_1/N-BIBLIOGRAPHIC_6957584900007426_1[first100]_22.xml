      <abstract>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: During the development of an even-aged plant
                population, the spatial distribution of individuals often changes from a clumped
                pattern to a random or regular one. The development of local size hierarchies in an
                Abies forest was analysed for a period of 47 years following a large disturbance in
                1959. METHODS: In 1980 all trees in an 8 x 8 m plot were mapped and their height
                growth after the disturbance was estimated. Their mortality and growth were then
                recorded at 1- to 4-year intervals between 1980 and 2006. Spatial distribution
                patterns of trees were analysed by the pair correlation function. Spatial
                correlations between tree heights were analysed with a spatial autocorrelation
                function and the mark correlation function. The mark correlation function was able
                to detect a local size hierarchy that could not be detected by the spatial
                autocorrelation function alone. KEY RESULTS: The small-scale spatial distribution
                pattern of trees changed from clumped to slightly regular during the 47 years.
                Mortality occurred in a density-dependent manner, which resulted in regular spacing
                between trees after 1980. The spatial autocorrelation and mark correlation functions
                revealed the existence of tree patches consisting of large trees at the initial
                stage. Development of a local size hierarchy was detected within the first decade
                after the disturbance, although the spatial autocorrelation was not negative. Local
                size hierarchies that developed persisted until 2006, and the spatial
                autocorrelation became negative at later stages (after about 40 years). CONCLUSIONS:
                This is the first study to detect local size hierarchies as a prelude to regular
                spacing using the mark correlation function. The results confirm that use of the
                mark correlation function together with the spatial autocorrelation function is an
                effective tool to analyse the development of a local size hierarchy of trees in a
                forest.</abstract>
