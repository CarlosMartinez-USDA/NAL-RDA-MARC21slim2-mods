      <abstract>Forests of the Eastern United States and North Eastern Canada have
                been devastated by the onslaught of beech bark disease (BBD). The cultivation and
                management of resistant trees is an important conservation issue. Disease resistance
                is an interplay between tree genetics and environmental factors. To further
                understand resistance to BBD, this studyinvestigates the contribution of topographic
                factors to both the occurrence and the severity of beech bark disease through the
                examination of small-scale patterns of disease.Approximately two hundred trees of
                the species Fagus grandifolia (American beech) located on an eighty-five-acre plot
                in southwestern Vermont were monitored over five years for the presence and severity
                of BBD. Trees were examined yearly, during which time diameter at breast height
                (DBH) was recorded as well as a measure of disease severity. Topographical factors
                (aspect, slope, curvature, elevation, and aspect•slope) were assessed as potential
                predictors of disease presence and severity. Two distance measures of disease
                presence in nearby trees were also included to control for the spatial spread of the
                disease.Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) was used to determine which subset of
                parameters yielded the best binary and ordinal logistic models of disease presence
                and rank. Bayesian analysis was used to determine the joint posterior distribution
                for model parameters.Slope was a both significant factors in determining disease
                presence. Slope•aspect was significant in determining both the presence and disease
                severity. DBH, time, and weighted distance to diseased trees were strong indicators
                of both disease presence and severity. Curvature and elevation were not significant
                factors. Predictive models based on identifiedlocaltopographical parameters can
                identify environmental factors conducive to resistance which canbe utilized toinform
                and designate regional beech restoration sites. Such models can alsoidentify
                potential candidate trees for resistance screening and genetic profiling. With the
                more recent availability of higher resolution USGS topographic maps for the
                northeastern United States, it is easier to determine and evaluate ideal resistant
                beech habitat. From these maps we can predict regions with healthier beech trees and
                suggest potential ecologically favorable restoration sites only using slope and
                aspect.</abstract>
