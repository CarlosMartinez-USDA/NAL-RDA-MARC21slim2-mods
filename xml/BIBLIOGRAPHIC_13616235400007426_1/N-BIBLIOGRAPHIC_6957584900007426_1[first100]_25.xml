      <abstract>The frequency of canopy disturbance over the past 150 years was
                reconstructed on a 5-ha study area dominated by a patchy mosaic of old-growth sugar
                maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.)
                forest in the Sylvania Wilderness Area in western Upper Michigan. The study area was
                divided into a 10-m grid system and one tree was cored near the center of each grid
                cell so that the spatial patterns of tree cohorts could be examined. The canopy
                turnover rate, averaged over all species and 150 years was 5.4% per decade, with a
                corresponding canopy residence time of 186 years. Canopy-residence times do not vary
                much between sugar maple (170 years) and hemlock (167 years), but yellow birch has a
                much longer canopy-residence time (232 years). Canopy-residence times calculated for
                individual decades over the last 150 years varied from 81 to 556 years. The spatial
                pattern of gaps of various ages is caused by disturbances in light intensity (2-12%
                canopy removal) that occur nearly every decade, each of which creates several to
                many small gaps scattered across the study area. As a result, the study area has a
                fine-grained random spatial mixture of age-classes at all distance classes from 5 m
                to &gt; 100 m. This mixture is stable throughout the mesic forest in the study area.
                None of the cohorts resulting from disturbance correspond spatially to patches
                dominated by either hemlock or sugar maple. Apparently, the dynamics of patch
                formation by gap-creating disturbances operate independently from the dynamics of
                the much larger monodominant patches. In forests such as the northern
                hardwood--hemlock type, where several tree lifetimes pass between any two
                large-scale catastrophic disturbances, spatial and temporal stability of the
                patch-dynamic processes (quasi equilibrium) may exist for periods of several decades
                in areas of &lt; 1 ha, and several thousand years for landscapes &gt; 10000 ha in
                size.</abstract>
