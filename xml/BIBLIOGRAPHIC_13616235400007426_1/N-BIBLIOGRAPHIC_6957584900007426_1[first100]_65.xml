      <abstract>The potential carbon sequestration in rangelands is largely due to
                the extensive areas they occupy, even though levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) are
                low. There is considerable uncertainty in achieving this potential due to the
                inherent patchy spatial and temporal distribution of rangeland vegetation and
                resources. At a paddock scale, determining appropriate sampling scales is a critical
                first step in the accurate estimation of size and spatial distribution of stocks of
                SOC. This issue was addressed by examining the spatial distribution of SOC and
                determining the association of SOC with other site characteristics such as ground
                cover and vegetation. This was done in a pilot study conducted in a 136-ha paddock
                located on the Cobar Pediplain Bioregion in western New South Wales, Australia. Each
                of 104 sites was sampled using a 0.25-m2 quadrat to assess biomass and ground cover
                category (percentage of perennial plants, bare ground, cryptogams, annual plants and
                litter) of a soil core taken from the centre of each quadrat, and proximity to trees
                and shrubs. The soil core was used to determine total organic C (TOC), total N (TN)
                and the C:N ratio at four depths (0–5; 5–10; 10–20; 20–30cm). From the quadrat and
                ground cover categories of the soil cores, six microsite categories were identified
                using cluster analysis: cryptogams; litter (≥25% litter); bare (≥60% bare ground);
                annual (≥40% annual plants); litter-P (≥15% litter and ≥10% perennial plants) and
                perennial (≥30% perennial plants). Microsite, depth in soil profile and the presence
                of trees and shrubs all had a significant (P&lt;0.001) effect on TOC concentration.
                The predicted means (s.e. of mean) of TOC at the soil surface (0–5cm) were perennial
                1.26 (0.04) %; litter-P 1.20 (0.05) %; annual 1.18 (0.06) %; litter 1.12 (0.05) %;
                bare 1.03 (0.05) % and cryptogams 0.88 (0.06) %. Higher concentrations of TOC were
                associated with the presence of trees and were almost 30% higher in close proximity
                (&lt;1m) to a tree. There was a consistent finding that higher concentrations of
                TOC, TN and the high values of C:N ratio were each associated with higher ground
                cover of perennial plants. The autocorrelation range for soil C stocks was ~30m and
                for categories of ground cover which varied from 10m to over 200m. The spatial
                predictions for ground cover of perennial plants closely mirrored those for C
                stocks, which were 22.9MgCha-1 in the top 30cm of soil in this environment. As both
                tree proximity and ground cover had a significant effect on TOC, quantifying the
                levels of soil organic C at a paddock scale will require an understanding of the
                spatial patterns of vegetation (woody and ground cover), which provides a basis for
                within-paddock stratification before soil sampling.</abstract>
