      <abstract>Climatic variability often is thought to be most important for
                ecosystem development at ecotones, while competition is thought to be most important
                farther from ecotones, where neighboring plants compete for scarce resources.
                However, climatic variability may also modulate consequences of competition,
                especially under recent and future climate change. Norway spruce (Picea abies)
                forests are among the most important ecosystems in the mountain regions of Europe
                and provide various ecosystem services. Many of these forests are currently in a
                self-thinning, stem-exclusion phase. Understanding processes governing forest
                dynamics during this phase is necessary for understanding future forest structure
                and processes as well as effects of climatic variability on ongoing forest
                development. We studied growth and mortality patterns in unmanaged 100–150years-old
                Norway spruce forests that originated after stand-replacing disturbances in the
                Parangalitsa Reserve in Bulgaria. We collected data on forest structure and tree
                ring samples from 648 live and dead trees (DBH &gt;4cm) to analyze onset, pattern
                and duration of mortality, as well as contributing factors.We found that climate
                extremes acted together with competition to cause sharp growth declines lasting from
                a few years to several decades and, in some cases, eventually led to death. The
                majority of dead trees had one to several consecutive growth declines, most of which
                initiated in response to extreme summer droughts during periods of high within-stand
                competition (after trees were 40–50years old). Our tree-ring analysis revealed that
                some suppressed trees that died were more drought-sensitive than living trees. Other
                climate extremes such as unusually cold winters or summers also contributed to sharp
                growth reductions in some cases. Trees that died had significantly lower initial
                radial growth, which suggests that in the absence of external disturbances, the
                outcome of mortality in the stem-exclusion stage may be pre-determined from factors
                that determine initial growth rates. Spatial distribution data showed that there was
                no significant aggregation of dead and live trees and that in almost all cases,
                neither live nor dead trees were clustered.Our findings contribute to understanding
                mortality processes in self-thinning subalpine Norway spruce forests in Europe and
                show that under climate change scenarios that include more frequent future droughts,
                even forests in which competition is thought to be the main driver of dynamics, may
                experience higher rates of mortality.</abstract>
