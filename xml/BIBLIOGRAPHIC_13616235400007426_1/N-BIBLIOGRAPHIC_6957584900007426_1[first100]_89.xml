      <abstract>Afforestation in arid zones is of increasing importance as it is one
                of the favored approaches to combat desertification. Rainfall interception by the
                canopy plays an important role in determining the amount of rainfall reaching the
                forest floor. The throughfall patterns of coniferous forests planted in arid zones
                have hitherto not been well documented. The research site in which the measurements
                were carried out was located within a mature pine forest (Pinus halepensis, Mill)
                planted in an arid zone (average annual precipitation: 280mm and annual class-A
                evaporation pan: 2500mm). Measurements of precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, soil
                water content and transpiration were recorded during three years. Canopy cover was
                estimated from the analysis of hemispherical photographs obtained during the winter.
                The spatially averaged throughfall, obtained for each event from 20 rainfall gauges
                installed below the canopy was linearly correlated with gross rainfall and
                independent of rainfall intensity. We found that the spatial distribution of the
                throughfall on the forest floor was highly heterogeneous. A fairly consistent
                distribution of throughfall was evident with some gauges steadily showing a higher
                percentage of throughfall than others. However, we could not find any relation
                between the degree of canopy openness (or any other quantifiable canopy
                characteristic) and the relative throughfall. The spatial pattern of throughfall was
                however found to be significant when assessed by means of the “K-means Clustering”
                analysis. The spatial distribution of water in the soil as measured 48h after
                rainfall events with a neutron gauge was not correlated to the distribution of
                throughfall when each of the measuring points was assessed individually. The average
                throughfall was however well correlated to the average increase in the soil water
                content and indicates that there is some degree of horizontal water movement
                (overland or below ground) within the plot. The results presented suggest that point
                measurements are not the correct tool for water balances of sparse canopy forests
                and that even for small plots horizontal sampling is of the essence. The practical
                implication of this study is that it shows that for this particular site a very
                large fraction of the rainfall reaches the ground and is thus available for plant
                and/or tree development, a key issue in an area with a rainless period of at least
                six months during which high pan evaporation rates prevail.</abstract>
