Wide‐ranging and large‐bodied species are especially vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation due to their typically low population densities, reflecting their need for extensive and connected habitats. We used the multi‐scale Random Forests machine learning algorithm to identify factors driving the habitat selection and future changes in habitat of Himalayan brown bear, an iconic wide‐ranging and large‐bodied species of high conservation interest, across a range of spatial scales. Habitat selection of brown bears was scale‐dependent, with most variables selected at broad scales. Climatic variables such as maximum temperature of coldest month, minimum temperature of warmest month and the potential evapotranspiration of wettest quarter strongly influenced habitat selection of brown bears. Future projections indicate a strong difference between the high and low emission scenarios. Alarmingly, our model suggests that high emission scenarios, with or without land use change, may result in a decline of brown bear habitat of >90% by the end of the century. In contrast, low emission scenarios are projected to reduce brown bear habitat by <23%, with much of the species range shifting to higher elevations. This study provides an integrative understanding of scale‐dependent variables in brown bear habitat selection, providing critical information for prioritizing areas for habitat management and conservation. Most importantly, our future projections imply that traditional conservation efforts, such as in situ conservation, will not be sufficient to protect the species without climate change mitigation. The incorporation of climate change mitigation and adaptation in conservation strategies will be one of the most pressing priorities in biodiversity conservation in this region.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cDepartment of Science and Technology, Government of India and The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research 3aUrsus arctos 3aalgorithms 3abiodiversity conservation 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3aextinction 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aland use change 3amodels 3atemperature1 aSingh, S.

One effect of increasing temperatures is on insect voltinism, with the logical assumption that increases in surface temperatures would permit multivoltine species to increase the number of generations per year. Though insect development is primarily driven by temperature, most multivoltine insect species rely on photoperiodic cues, which do not change from year-to-year or in response to climate warming, to initiate diapause. Thus, the relationship between climate change and voltinism could be complex. We use a phenology model for grape berry moth, Paralobesia viteana (Clemens), which incorporates temperature-dependent development and diapause termination, and photoperiod-dependent diapause induction, to explore historical patterns in year-to-year voltinism fluctuations. We then extend this model to predict voltinism under varying scenarios of climate change to show the importance of both the quality and quantity of accumulated heat units. We also illustrate that increases in mean surface temperatures > 2 °C can have dramatic effects on insect voltinism by causing a shift in the ovipositional period that currently is subject to diapause-inducing photoperiods.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aprediction 3aoviposition 3amultivoltine habit 3aphenology 3amodels 3adiapause 3aglobal warming 3asurface temperature 3aseasonal variation 3ainsect development 3aheat sums 3apopulation dynamics 3aEndopiza viteana 3aphotoperiodism 0aclimate change 0aphenology model1 aNAGARKATTI, SUDHA1 aLOEB, GREG1 aSAUNDERS, MICHAEL C.0 tGlobal change biology.g2008 May, v.  14, no.  5 p.951-957dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl57021  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01561.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/323313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c14d5e951  fGlobal change biology  aissued  a20090818b20091002c00000000  aIND440517819ExL  aINDdNZMe2009/08/18  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20090818 20091002 00000000bIND NZM 2009/08/18  aUSDA/FS  aagid:32331  a2009-10-03  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a405178103696nab a2200817 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024005400097024002100151035002600172040001800198072000900216072000900225072000900234100001600243245010100259300001600360500002400376500001500400520115900415593001801574593002001592650001801612650001401630650001201644650001701656650002601673650001901699650001601718650001301734650001701747650001201764651003101776651002101807651001101828653001701839653001901856653001501875700001801890700001301908700001901921700001901940700001601959700001601975700001701991700001902008773009902027787001802126787003302144787003002177787001902207852000902226856010802235856011202343912001202455914004002467914004502507917001102552930003302563935002102596945002502617946001302642949001502655952005102670961001202721974001502733984001502748985010302763986001202866991559434530742620221122024354.0080506e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440529492DNAL7 a10.1890/1540-9295(2007)5[499:FFACCI]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/153472hdl  aagid:15347-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK810 0aB200 0aJ4001 aGavin, D.G.10aForest fire and climate change in western North America: insights from sediment charcoal records  ap. 499-506.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aMillennial-scale records of forest fire provide important baseline information for ecosystem management, especially in regions with too few recent fires to describe the historical range of variability. Charcoal records from lake sediments and soil profiles are well suited for reconstructing the incidence of past fire and its relationship to changing climate and vegetation. We highlight several records from western North America and their relevance in reconstructing historical forest dynamics, fire-climate relationships, and feedbacks between vegetation and fire under climate change. Climatic effects on fire regimes are evident in many regions, but comparisons of paleo-fire records sometimes show a lack of synchrony, indicating that local factors substantially affect fire occurrence, even over long periods. Furthermore, the specific impacts of vegetation change on fire regimes differ among regions with different vegetation histories. By documenting the effects on fire patterns of major changes in climate and vegetation, paleo-fire records can be used to test the mechanistic models required for the prediction of future variations in fire.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3asoil profiles 3asediments 3ahistory 3apaleoecology 3abotanical composition 3aclimate change 3afire regime 3acharcoal 3aforest fires 3aforests 3aNorthwestern United States 3aBritish Columbia 3aAlaska 0afire ecology 0afire frequency 0avegetation1 aHallett, D.J.1 aHu, F.S.1 aLertzman, K.P.1 aPrichard, S.J.1 aBrown, K.J.1 aLynch, J.A.1 aBartlein, P.1 aPeterson, D.L.0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2007 Nov., v.  5, no.  9 p.499-506x1540-92957nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)12355  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1540-9295(2007)5%5B499:FFACCI%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/153473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:12355b1540-9295c5d9e499  fFrontiers in ecology and the environment  aissued  a20080528b20080606c00000000  aIND440529499ExL  aINDdLYNe2008/05/28  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20080528 20080606 00000000bIND LYN 2008/05/28  aUSDA/FS  aagid:15347  a2010-02-13  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a405294904860nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100023100179245012300410300001400533520197400547592002802521593001802549650001702567650001702584650001202601650001902613650001902632650001502651650001502666650001902681650001902700650002202719650001302741650001502754650002402769650001302793650000902806651002102815700015502836700021102991700014103202700019303343773011503536787003303651787001803684787002403702856008203726912001203808914004503820914002203865916001503887917001103902918002903913935002203942949001503964953006703979954005604046955003704102961001204139974001704151983001504168984001504183991559451030742620221117161646.0190816e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063119712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-018-0743-82doi  aagid:6311971-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErgüner, YasemineauthoruClimate Change Science Institute, Computational Earth Sciences Group, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN, 37831-6301, USA. yasebaytok@gmail.com1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8144-562010aMapping ecoregions under climate change: a case study from the biological ‘crossroads’ of three continents, Turkey  ap. 35-50.  aCONTEXT: Besides climate change vulnerability, most ecosystems are under threat from a history of improper land-use and conservation policies, yet there is little existing long-term ecological research infrastructure in Turkey. In regions with no ecological networks across large landscapes, ecoregion concept offers opportunities for characterizing the landscape under changing climate. OBJECTIVES: Aim is to develop contemporary and future quantitative ecoregions for Turkey based on climate model outputs, to identify climate change-sensitive areas of biodiversity and conservation significance, and to provide a framework for a comprehensive ecological observatory network design. METHODS: Using Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Clustering and climate data contemporary and projected future distributions of Turkey’s ecoregions are delineated at several division levels. RESULTS: Turkey’s contemporary ecoregions generally show a northward shift by the end of this century and the lengthening of the growing season across the country, especially eastward and northward. The increase in growing season length, along with the shift in precipitation seasonality and increasing growing season precipitation, shape future conditions within the climate change-sensitive areas. Apart from transboundary ecological and socioeconomic significance, these potentially vulnerable ecosystems also constitute the majority of Turkey’s biodiversity hotspots. CONCLUSIONS: Our study marks the first ‘ecoregionalization’ study for Turkey based on both contemporary and future climate scenarios. For countries like Turkey, where large-scale ecological networks have not been established, using such quantitative methodology for delineation of optimal ecoclimatic regions, and for mapping environments at risk from climate change provides an invaluable perspective for conservation planning strategies, and a framework for a comprehensive ecological observatory network design.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aecoregions 3aecosystems 3agrowing season 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alandscapes 3ameteorological data 3aplanning 3arisk 3aTurkey (country)1 aKumar, JitendraeauthoruTerrestrial Systems Modeling Group, Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA1 aHoffman, Forrest M.eauthoruClimate Change Science Institute, Computational Earth Sciences Group, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN, 37831-6301, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5802-41341 aDalfes, H.

Understanding how climate change may affect the suitability of habitats for ticks will improve the accuracy of risk maps of tick-borne pathogen transmission in humans and domestic animal populations. Lyme disease (LD) is the most prevalent arthropod borne disease in the US and Europe. The bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi causes LD and it is transmitted to humans and other mammalian hosts through the bite of infected Ixodes ticks. LD risk maps in the transboundary region between the U.S. and Mexico are lacking. Moreover, none of the published studies that evaluated the effect of climate change in the spatial and temporal distribution of I. scapularis have focused on this region. METHODS: The area of study included Texas and a portion of northeast Mexico. This area is referred herein as the Texas-Mexico transboundary region. Tick samples were obtained from various vertebrate hosts in the region under study. Ticks identified as I. scapularis were processed to obtain DNA and to determine if they were infected with B. burgdorferi using PCR. A maximum entropy approach (MAXENT) was used to forecast the present and future (2050) distribution of B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis in the Texas-Mexico transboundary region by correlating geographic data with climatic variables. RESULTS: Of the 1235 tick samples collected, 109 were identified as I. scapularis. Infection with B. burgdorferi was detected in 45% of the I. scapularis ticks collected. The model presented here indicates a wide distribution for I. scapularis, with higher probability of occurrence along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Results of the modeling approach applied predict that habitat suitable for the distribution of I. scapularis in the Texas-Mexico transboundary region will remain relatively stable until 2050. CONCLUSIONS: The Texas-Mexico transboundary region appears to be part of a continuum in the pathogenic landscape of LD. Forecasting based on climate trends provides a tool to adapt strategies in the near future to mitigate the impact of LD related to its distribution and risk for transmission to human populations in the Mexico-US transboundary region.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aDNA 3aIxodes scapularis 3aLyme disease 3abacteria 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adomestic animals 3ahabitats 3ahosts 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3aticks 2aAnimal Distribution 2aAnimals 2aArthropod Vectorsxmicrobiologyxphysiology 2aBorrelia burgdorferixisolation & purification 2aClimate Change 2aDNA, Bacterialxisolation & purification 2aIxodesxphysiology 2aLyme Diseasexepidemiologyxtransmission 2aPhylogeny 2aRisk Factors 3aEurope 3aGulf of Mexico 3aMexico 3aTexas 0aMexicoxepidemiology 0aTexasxepidemiology1 aCastro-Arellano, Ivaneauthor1 aGordillo-Perez, Guadalupeeauthor1 aCavazos, Ana Leauthor1 aVargas-Sandoval, Margaritaeauthor1 aGrover, Abhaeauthor1 aTorres, Javiereauthor1 aMedina, Raul Feauthor1 ade León, Adalberto A Pérezeauthor1 aEsteve-Gassent, Maria Deauthor0 tParasites & vectors.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.199-199dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl434748640uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-7-1993Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4347486b1756-3305c7d1e1393  fParasites & vectors  aBatch:784  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND5008961869ExL  a2015-02-24  aftp_PUB_16-09-15_06-22-04.zip  aUSDA/ARS  aJournal title changed from 'Parasites Vectors'  aBatch:784 annotated on 2015-01-29T15:03:33Z  aBatch:784 reviewed on 2015-02-24T04:00:03Z  aBatch:784 reviewed on 2015-02-24T11:00:02Z  aagid:356379  a2016-10-29  a2016-10-2904584nab a2200853 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003200097024002100129035002600150040001800176072000900194072000900203072000900212072000900221072000900230100001600239245011900255500002400374520202500398593001802423650002202441650001002463650003002473650002002503650001702523650002502540650001902565650001602584650002202600650001902622650002002641650001502661650001502676651001102691653002102702653002002723700001602743700001702759700001602776700002202792700001802814700001802832700001402850700001802864700001602882700001502898700001502913700002202928700001502950700001702965773007702982787001803059787003003077787003303107852000903140856011203149856008203261912001203343914004803355917001103403930003303414935002103447945002503468946001103493949001503504952005103519961001503570974001503585984001503600985010303615986001203718991559843320742620221118211052.0080626s2008    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND440717562DNAL7 a10.1186/1476-072X-7-242doi7 a10113/165112hdl  aagid:16511-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL832 0aL700 0aL001 0aB2001 aOgden, N.H.10aRisk maps for range expansion of the Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis, in Canada now and with climate change  aIncludes references  aBackground: Lyme disease is the commonest vector-borne zoonosis in the temperate world, and an emerging infectious disease in Canada due to expansion of the geographic range of the tick vector Ixodes scapularis. Studies suggest that climate change will accelerate Lyme disease emergence by enhancing climatic suitability for I. scapularis. Risk maps will help to meet the public health challenge of Lyme disease by allowing targeting of surveillance and intervention activities. Results: A risk map for possible Lyme endemicity was created using a simple risk algorithm for occurrence of I. scapularis populations. The algorithm was calculated for each census sub-division in central and eastern Canada from interpolated output of a temperature-driven simulation model of I. scapularis populations and an index of tick immigration. The latter was calculated from estimates of tick dispersion distances by migratory birds and recent knowledge of the current geographic range of endemic I. scapularis populations. The index of tick immigration closely predicted passive surveillance data on I. scapularis occurrence, and the risk algorithm was a significant predictor of the occurrence of I. scapularis populations in a prospective field study. Risk maps for I. scapularis occurrence in Canada under future projected climate (in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s) were produced using temperature output from the Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model 2 with greenhouse gas emission scenario enforcing 'A2' of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Conclusion: We have prepared risk maps for the occurrence of I. scapularis in eastern and central Canada under current and future projected climate. Validation of the risk maps provides some confidence that they provide a useful first step in predicting the occurrence of I. scapularis populations, and directing public health objectives in minimizing risk from Lyme disease. Further field studies are needed, however, to continue validation and refinement of the risk maps.  aPubAg article 3aIxodes scapularis 3aticks 3ageographical distribution 3adisease vectors 3aLyme disease 3adisease surveillance 3aclimate change 3atemperature 3asimulation models 3aclimate models 3arisk assessment 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 3aCanada 0atick immigration 0arisk algorithms1 aSt-Onge, L.1 aBarker, I.K.1 aBrazeau, S.1 aBigras-Poulin, M.1 aCharron, D.F.1 aFrancis, C.M.1 aHeagy, A.1 aLindsay, L.R.1 aMaarouf, A.1 aMichel, P.1 aMilord, F.1 aO'Callaghan, C.J.1 aTrudel, L.1 aThompson, A.0 tInternational journal of health geographics.g2008, v.  7, no.  247nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/165113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1476-072X-7-243Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fInternational journal of health geographics  aissued  a20080709b20080801c00000000  aIND440717569ExL  aINDdNZMe2008/07/03  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20080709 20080801 00000000bIND NZM 2008/07/03  aUSDA/APHIS  aagid:16511  a2008-08-02  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a407175604170nab a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004200097024002100139035002600160040001800186072000900204072000900213100002100222245013600243300001800379500002400397500001500421520196100436593001802397593002002415650002302435650001902458650001702477650001202494650002102506650002402527650001502551650001302566651001702579653001502596700001602611700001702627700001902644773010902663787001802772787003302790787003002823787002202853852000902875856009202884856011202976912001203088914004503100914002603145917001103171930003303182935002103215945002503236946001103261949001503272952005103287961001303338974001503351984001503366985010303381986001203484991559843480742620221118212106.0080606e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440643762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01599.x2doi7 a10113/164842hdl  aagid:16484-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aB2001 aPolley, H.

Variability in climatic drivers may directly affect fluxes, but also may indirectly affect fluxes by altering the response of the biota to the environment, an effect termed 'functional change'. We measured net ecosystem exchange of CO₂ (NEE) and its diurnal components, daytime ecosystem CO₂ exchange (PD) and night-time respiration (RE), on grazed and ungrazed mixed-grass prairie in North Dakota, USA, for five growing seasons. Our primary objective was to determine how climatic anomalies influence variability in CO₂ exchange. We used regression analysis to distinguish direct effects of IAV in climate on fluxes from functional change. Functional change was quantified as the improvement in regression on fitting a model in which slopes of flux-climate relationships vary among years rather than remain invariant. Functional change and direct effects of climatic variation together explained about 20% of variance in weekly means of NEE, PD, and RE. Functional change accounted for more than twice the variance in fluxes of direct effects of climatic variability. Grazing did not consistently influence the contribution of functional change to flux variability, but altered which environmental variable best explained year-to-year differences in flux-climate slopes, reduced IAV in seasonal means of fluxes, lessened the strength of flux-climate correlations, and increased NEE by reducing RE relatively more than PD. Most of these trends are consistent with the interpretation that grazing reduced the influence of plants on ecosystem fluxes. Because relationships between weekly values of fluxes and climatic regulators changed annually, year-to-year differences in the C balance of these ecosystems cannot be predicted from knowledge of IAV in climate alone.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3atemporal variation 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3agrazing 3aclimatic factors 3aregression analysis 3aecosystems 3aprairies 3aNorth Dakota 0agrasslands1 aFrank, A.B.1 aSanabria, J.1 aPhillips, R.L.0 tGlobal change biology.g2008 July, v.  14, no.  7 p.1620-1632dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl57021  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01599.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/164843Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c14d7e1620  fGlobal change biology  aissued  a20080702b20080801c00000000  aIND440643769ExL  aINDdGAYe2008/07/02  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20080702 20080801 00000000bIND GAY 2008/07/02  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:16484  a2008-08-02  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a406437604604nab a2200841 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097024002100132035002600153040001800179072000900197072000900206072000900215072000900224072000900233072000900242100002000251245012300271300001600394500002400410520194500434593001802379593002002397650001902417650001502436650001102451650001802462650001402480650001602494650000902510650001202519650001702531650001002548650003102558650002002589650002002609650001902629650003102648650001202679650002202691650003302713651003102746700001702777700001902794700001702813700001702830700002202847773013802869787001803007787003303025787003003058787002403088852000903112856011203121856008503233912001203318914004803330914005903378917001103437930003303448935002103481945002503502946001103527949001503538952005103553961001303604974001503617984001503632985010303647986001203750991559857500742620221118211732.0080516e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440579912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-007-9125-22doi7 a10113/164762hdl  aagid:16476-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aL100 0aF100 0aF821 0aF900 0aF8301 aWolfe, David W.10aProjected change in climate thresholds in the Northeastern U.S.: implications for crops, pests, livestock, and farmers  ap. 555-575.  aIncludes references  aMost prior climate change assessments for U.S. agriculture have focused on major world food crops such as wheat and maize. While useful from a national and global perspective, these results are not particularly relevant to the Northeastern U.S. agriculture economy, which is dominated by dairy milk production, and high-value horticultural crops such as apples (Malus domestica), grapes (Vitis vinifera), sweet corn (Zea mays var. rugosa), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), and maple syrup (sugar maple, Acer saccharum). We used statistically downscaled climate projections generated by the HadCM3 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, run with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change future emissions scenarios A1fi (higher) and B1 (lower), to evaluate several climate thresholds of direct relevance to agriculture in the region. A longer (frost-free) growing season could create new opportunities for farmers with enough capital to take risks on new crops (assuming a market for new crops can be developed). However, our results indicate that many crops will have yield losses associated with increased frequency of high temperature stress, inadequate winter chill period for optimum fruiting in spring, increased pressure from marginally over-wintering and/or invasive weeds, insects, or disease, or other factors. Weeds are likely to benefit more than cash crops from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Projections of thermal heat index values for dairy cows indicate a substantial potential negative impact on milk production. At the higher compared to lower emissions scenario, negative climate change effects will occur sooner, and impact a larger geographic area within the region. Farmer adaptations to climate change will not be cost- or risk-free, and the impact on individual farm families and rural communities will depend on commodity produced, available capital, and timely, accurate climate projections.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aclimate change 3aprediction 3amodels 3adairy farming 3alivestock 3aheat stress 3arain 3adrought 3ainsect pests 3aweeds 3aintegrated pest management 3acrop production 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3afarmers 3asocial adjustment 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aNortheastern United States1 aZiska, Lewis1 aPetzoldt, Curt1 aSeaman, Abby1 aChase, Larry1 aHayhoe, Katharine0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2008 June, v.  13, no.  5-6 p.555-575dSpringer Netherlandsx1381-23867nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl3870070  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/164763Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-007-9125-23Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3870070b1381-2386c13d5-6e555  fMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change  aissued  a20080702b20080801c00000000  aIND440579919ExL  aINDdGAYe2008/07/02  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20080702 20080801 00000000bIND GAY 2008/07/02  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:16476  a2008-08-02  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a405799103617nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097024002100132035002600153040001800179072000900197072000900206072000900215100002000224245008200244300001600326500002400342500001500366520133100381593001801712593002001730650001901750650001601769650001401785650001701799650001901816650003101835650001101866650001801877650001601895650001701911651003101928653002101959700002101980700002502001773013802026787001802164787003302182787003002215787002402245852000902269856011202278856008502390912001202475914004802487914005902535917001102594930003302605935002102638945002502659946001102684949001502695952005102710961001302761974001502774984001502789985010302804986001202907991559858920742620221118212140.0080516e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440579942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-007-9134-12doi7 a10113/164772hdl  aagid:16477-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aF600 0aX3801 aZiska, Lewis H.10aClimate change, aerobiology, and public health in the Northeast United States  ap. 607-613.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe epidemiological implications with respect to climate change and public health (e.g., shifts in disease vectors) are beginning to be acknowledged. Less recognized however, are the potential links between climate, plant biology and public health. In addition to being affected by climate (e.g., temperature determines plant range), carbon dioxide (CO₂) represents the raw material needed for photosynthesis and its rapid increase in the atmosphere is expected to stimulate plant growth. While there are a number of means by which plant biology intersects with human health (e.g., plant nutrition), one of the most widely recognized is aerobiology; specifically, the ability of plants to both produce pollen and to serve as a substrate for molds/fungi (e.g., sporulation). The current review represents an initial attempt to coalesce what is known regarding the likely impacts of climate/CO₂ on plant pollen/fungal spores and associated allergic disease that are, or could be, specific to the Northeast United States. Although the current results indicate a number of potentially unfavorable effects, we wish to stress that the current data are based on a small number of experiments. Additional data are crucial to both reduce epidemiological uncertainty and to derive a robust set of mitigation / adaptation strategies.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3acarbon dioxide 3asporulation 3aallergens 3ahuman health 3aclimate change 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aasthma 3afungal spores 3apollination 3aurbanization 3aNortheastern United States 0ahypersensitivity1 aEpstein, Paul R.1 aRogers, Christine A.0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2008 June, v.  13, no.  5-6 p.607-613dSpringer Netherlandsx1381-23867nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl3870070  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/164773Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-007-9134-13Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3870070b1381-2386c13d5-6e607  fMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change  aissued  a20080702b20080801c00000000  aIND440579949ExL  aINDdGAYe2008/07/02  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20080702 20080801 00000000bIND GAY 2008/07/02  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:16477  a2008-08-02  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a405799402072nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075035002800097040001800125072001700143072001700160072001700177072001700194100001400211245009500225300001200320500001500332650001500347650002300362650002100385650002800406650002300434650001000457650003000467650002300497650002000520650002300540650002400563650001100587650001900598650001700617650001100634650002200645650001100667650003400678650001100712650001700723650002500740651001000765653001000775653002500785700001400810773009200824787003300916787001800949852000900967912001200976914001700988914004301005917001101048930003301059935002101092945002501113946001301138952005101151961001301202974001701215984001501232985010301247986001201350991559962740742620221121043528.0080225e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440192792DNAL  aagid:2758755-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The intersection of climate change with evolutionary conservative aspects of host specificity and transmission dynamics, called ecological fitting, permits emergence of parasites and diseases without evolutionary changes in their capacity for host utilization.  aPubAg article 3aparasitism 3aevolution 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aemerging diseases 3adisease transmission 3aglobal warming 3ahost specificity 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aDisease Vectors 2aEcosystem 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxphysiology 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aParasitesxphysiology 2aParasitic Diseasesxparasitology 0ainfectious diseases 0ahost switching 0aclimate change 0aecological fitting1 aHoberg, Eric P.0 tTrends in parasitology.g2007 Dec., v.  23, no.  12 p.571-5747nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/255603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2007.08.0163Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fTrends in parasitology  aissued  a20090225b20090301c00000000  aIND441676199ExL  aINDdNZMe2009/02/25  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20090225 20090301 00000000bIND NZM 2009/02/25  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:25560  a2012-06-07  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a416761904659nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100018600171245011500357300001800472500002000490500001500510520161500525592002802140593001802168650001502186650001702201650002302218650001002241650001202251650001902263650001502282650002202297650002102319650002102340650002302361650001202384650001202396651002302408651001902431653001502450700018502465700018902650700018302839700018703022700018903209773010603398787003303504787001803537787002203555856007303577912001203650914004503662914002603707916001503733917001103748918004303759935002203802949001503824953002703839961001203866962004803878974001703926983001503943984001503958991560206890742620221122173250.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054788522DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.133092doi  aagid:5478852-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaldwell, Peter V.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Center for Forest Watershed Research, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, 3160 Coweeta Lab Road, Otto, NC, 28734, USA10aDeclining water yield from forested mountain watersheds in response to climate change and forest mesophication  ap. 2997-3012.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aClimate change and forest disturbances are threatening the ability of forested mountain watersheds to provide the clean, reliable, and abundant fresh water necessary to support aquatic ecosystems and a growing human population. Here, we used 76 years of water yield, climate, and field plot vegetation measurements in six unmanaged, reference watersheds in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, USA to determine whether water yield has changed over time, and to examine and attribute the causal mechanisms of change. We found that annual water yield increased in some watersheds from 1938 to the mid‐1970s by as much as 55%, but this was followed by decreases up to 22% by 2013. Changes in forest evapotranspiration were consistent with, but opposite in direction to the changes in water yield, with decreases in evapotranspiration up to 31% by the mid‐1970s followed by increases up to 29% until 2013. Vegetation survey data showed commensurate reductions in forest basal area until the mid‐1970s and increases since that time accompanied by a shift in dominance from xerophytic oak and hickory species to several mesophytic species (i.e., mesophication) that use relatively more water. These changes in forest structure and species composition may have decreased water yield by as much as 18% in a given year since the mid‐1970s after accounting for climate. Our results suggest that changes in climate and forest structure and species composition in unmanaged forests brought about by disturbance and natural community dynamics over time can result in large changes in water supply.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3afreshwater 3awater supply 3aevapotranspiration 3aCarya 3asurveys 3aclimate change 3awatersheds 3aspecies diversity 3ahuman population 3astand basal area 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aclimate 3aforests 3aAppalachian region 3aNorth Carolina 0abasal area1 aMiniat, Chelcy F.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Center for Forest Watershed Research, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, 3160 Coweeta Lab Road, Otto, NC, 28734, USA1 aElliott, Katherine J.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Center for Forest Watershed Research, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, 3160 Coweeta Lab Road, Otto, NC, 28734, USA1 aSwank, Wayne T.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Center for Forest Watershed Research, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, 3160 Coweeta Lab Road, Otto, NC, 28734, USA1 aBrantley, Steven T.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Center for Forest Watershed Research, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, 3160 Coweeta Lab Road, Otto, NC, 28734, USA1 aLaseter, Stephanie H.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Center for Forest Watershed Research, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, 3160 Coweeta Lab Road, Otto, NC, 28734, USA0 tGlobal change biology.g2016 Sept., v. 22, no. 9 p.2997-3012dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.133093Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c22d9e2997  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:1483  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6054788529ExL  a2016-12-08  a13541013_2016_22_9.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1483 reviewed on 2016-12-08T04:00:03Z  aagid:5478852  a2016-09-03  a2016-12-0804216nab a2200637 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002800098035002800126040001800154100010800172245009200280300001800372500002000390520176000410592002802170593001802198650003102216650001602247650003402263650001302297650002002310650001202330650001902342650001902361650001502380650001502395650001302410651001902423700013302442700011302575700009202688700011202780773011902892787003303011787001803044787002203062856007503084912001203159914004603171914002103217916001603238917001103254918004303265935002203308949001503330952001903345953005803364954006203422955003403484961001303518974001703531983001503548984001503563991560301280742620221118200839.0220424e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077535452DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.205482doi  aagid:7753545-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, L.eauthoruRangeland Resources and Systems Research Unit, USDA‐ARS, Fort Collins, CO, 80526, USA10aSimulated climate change effects on soybean production using two crop modules in RZWQM2  ap. 1349-1365.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe ability to predict climate change effects on crop yield through field experiments and crop modeling is essential for developing mitigation strategies. The objective of this study was to compare two different crop modules (CROPGRO and HERMES) in the Root Zone Water Quality Model 2 (RZWQM2) for predicting climate change effects on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production. The modules were previously calibrated for measured temperature responses using data from a 4‐yr open‐top chamber experiment (2015–2018) in North Carolina. Both crop modules simulated similar climate change effects in terms of yield and biomass by the end of Year 2100 (2083–2099) using 40 general circulation model (GCM) projections and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), compared with the simulations using current baseline (2002–2018). For both modules, much greater reductions in biomass and seed yield were simulated under RCP8.5 than under RCP4.5 due to higher air temperature. In addition, both modules predicted lower variability of biomass and seed yield across these GCMs under irrigated than under rainfed conditions. CROPGRO predicted a greater positive climate change effect in response to the projected higher precipitation and increased atmospheric CO₂ (compared with baseline conditions) than HERMES. Soybean production will likely benefit more from the projected high precipitation and elevated CO₂ under rainfed conditions than under irrigated conditions. Due to much higher simulated yield under irrigation than under rainfed conditions, supplementary irrigation may be an effective mitigation strategy to maintain soybean yield; however, adjusting sowing dates appear to have little effect on soybean production.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aGlycine max 3aRoot Zone Water Quality Model 3aagronomy 3aair temperature 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3airrigation 3aseed yield 3asoybeans 3aNorth Carolina1 aFang, Q.

The computer simulation-based assessment was done using CropSyst, a cropping systems simulation model, and projected daily weather data downscaled to a 4×4km grid using 12 general circulation models (GCMs) for two atmospheric CO₂ representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The study region was divided into 3 agro-ecological zones (AEZs): continuous cropping (CC), continuous cropping-fallow transition (CCF), and crop-fallow (CF), with the following typical rotations assigned to the zones: winter wheat (WW) – summer fallow (SF) (CF zone), WW – spring wheat (SW) – SF (CCF zone), and WW – SW – spring pea (CC zone). By the 2070s (2065–2085), precipitation in the IPNW is projected to increase by about 8 and 12% compared to the baseline period under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. Mean temperature during the WW growing season will increase about 1.5 and 2.3°C under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively, but will not change noticeably during the SW growing season due to the adaptive early planting used in this study. Concurrently, atmospheric CO₂ concentration will increase from today's average of ~400ppm to 532ppm to 801ppm by 2085 depending on future emissions of greenhouse gases. Soil water-crop growth interactions, which show large variation across the region, will modulate crop responses to these changing conditions, with our results showing an overall increase in yield across the IPNW. By the 2070s, the mean ratio of future to baseline WW yield will range from 1.29 to 1.35 under RCP 4.5 and from 1.41 to 1.64 under RCP 8.5 depending on the AEZ. The mean yield ratio for SW across AEZs will range from 1.38 to 1.53 under RCP 4.5 and 1.54 to 1.91 under RCP 8.5. Given substantial climatic heterogeneity in the region, these gains will not be distributed equally across the region or within AEZs, and overall they will not be shared equally by all growers.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagroecological zones 3aarid lands 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acomputer simulation 3acontinuous cropping 3adryland farming 3afallow 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agrowers 3agrowing season 3ameteorological data 3apeas 3aplanting date 3asimulation models 3asoil 3aspring wheat 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter wheat 3aPacific States 0aGlobal climate model 0aRepresentative concentration pathway 0aAgroecological zone1 aStöckle, C.O.eauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA1 aHiggins, S.eauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA1 aNelson, R.eauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA0 tAgricultural systems.g2018 Jan., v. 159 p.144-156dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl718640uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2017.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl7186b0308-521Xc159e144  fAgricultural systems  aBatch:1782  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6056554349ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/783157386678757935-00005-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0308521X17300148.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1873-2267  aMissing ISSN  aagid:5655434  a2020-11-25  a2022-09-0206014nab a2200937 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004200098024003900140024004600179035002800225040001800253100013200271245010600403300001400509506007600523506003100599520240200630592002803032593001803060596008303078596002703161506003703188650003703225650001103262650001203273650001903285650001903304650001803323650001503341650001103356650001103367650001903378650001403397650001303411650002203424650001703446650001603463650001603479650002703495650002203522650001503544650001803559650002503577650001503602650001403617651001003631651003003641651002603671653001303697653001203710653001903722653001503741653001403756700012903770700013303899700013504032700010904167700013204276773011704408787003304525787001804558787002204576856008604598912001204684914004104696914002504737916001504762917001104777918003604788935002204824949001504846953006004861954006104921955003504982961001205017974001705029983001505046984001505061991560406220742620221207095716.0190318e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060590212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.02.0252chorus7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.02.0252doi7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.02.0252chorusOpen  aagid:6059021-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGould, Gregory K.eauthoruDepartment of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99163, USA14aThe effects of climate change and extreme wildfire events on runoff erosion over a mountain watershed  ap. 74-91.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aIncreases in wildfire occurrence and severity under an altered climate can substantially impact terrestrial ecosystems through enhancing runoff erosion. Improved prediction tools that provide high resolution spatial information are necessary for location-specific soil conservation and watershed management. However, quantifying the magnitude of soil erosion and its interactions with climate, hydrological processes, and fire occurrences across a large region (>10,000km2) is challenging because of the large computational requirements needed to capture the fine-scale complexities of the land surface that govern erosion. We apply the physically-based coupled Variable Capacity Infiltration–Water Erosion Prediction Project (VIC–WEPP) model to study how wildfire occurrences can enhance soil erosion in a future climate over a representative watershed in the northern Rocky Mountains – the Salmon River Basin (SRB) in central Idaho. While the VIC model simulates hydrologic processes at larger scales, the WEPP model simulates erosion at the hillslope scale by sampling representative hillslopes.VIC–WEPP model results indicate that SRB streamflow will have an earlier shift in peak flow by one to two months under future climate scenarios in response to a declining snowpack under warming temperatures. The magnitude of peak flow increases with each higher severity fire scenario; and under the highest fire severity, the peak flow is shifted even earlier, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Similarly, sediment yield also increases with higher fire severities for both historical and future climates. Sediment yield is more sensitive to fire occurrence than to climate change by one to two orders of magnitude, which is not unexpected given that our fire scenarios were applied basin wide as worst case scenarios. In reality, fires only occur over portions of the basin in any given year and subsequent years’ vegetation regrowth reduces erosion. However, the effects of climate change on sediment yield result in greater spatial heterogeneities, primarily because of the spatial differences in precipitation projections, while fire conditions were uniformly applied. The combined effects of climate change and a possible continuation of increasing fire frequency and severity will compound excess sediment issues that already exist in this region of the intermountain West.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cU.S. Geological Survey0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWater Erosion Prediction Project 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afire frequency 3afire severity 3aprediction 3arivers 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asnowpack 3asoil conservation 3aspatial data 3astream flow 3atemperature 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atopographic slope 3avegetation 3awater erosion 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3awildfires 3aIdaho 3aIntermountain West region 3aRocky Mountain region 0aWildfire 0aErosion 0aClimate change 0aWEPP model 0aHydrology1 aLiu, MingliangeauthoruDepartment of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99163, USA1 aBarber, Michael E.eauthoruDepartment of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99163, USA1 aCherkauer, Keith A.eauthoruDepartment of Agricultural & Biological Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA1 aRobichaud, Peter R.eauthoruRocky Mountain Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Moscow, ID 83843, USA1 aAdam, Jennifer C.eauthoruDepartment of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99163, USA0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 May, v. 536 p.74-91dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4653940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46539b0022-1694c536e74  fJournal of hydrology  aBatch:2065  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6060590219ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00010-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0022169416300592.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6059021  a2019-03-18  a2022-09-0605153nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098035002800137040001800165100009300183245014700276300001400423520194000437592002802377593001802405650001202423650001902435650001102454650001902465650001502484650002202499650001602521650001802537650001502555650002102570650001702591650001702608650001702625650001502642651001802657653001702675653002302692653001902715653001802734653001902752653002202771700013702793700016802930700017903098700013003277700011103407700009603518700010703614773010303721787003303824787001803857787002203875856008603897912001203983914004103995914002504036916001504061917001104076918003604087935002204123949001504145953008004160954006104240955003504301961001204336974001704348983001504365984001504380991560841270742620221118224259.0190516e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062893542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.01.0112doi  aagid:6289354-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, KaieauthoruSchool of Civil Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China10aUnderstanding the role of regional water connectivity in mitigating climate change impacts on surface water supply stress in the United States  ap. 80-95.  aSurface water supply for a watershed relies on local water generated from precipitation and water connections with other watersheds. These connections are confined by topography and infrastructure, and respond diversely to stressors such as climate change, population growth, increasing energy and water demands. This study presents an integrative simulation and evaluation framework that incorporates the natural and anthropogenic water connections (i.e., stream flows, inter-basin water transfers, water withdrawals and return flows) among the 2099 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC-8) watersheds across the conterminous United States. The framework is then applied to investigate the potential impacts of changes in climate and water use on regional water availability and water stress (the ratio of demand to supply). Our projections suggest that highly water-stressed areas may expand from 14% to 18% and the stressed population would increase from 19% to 24% by 2070–2099. Climate-change mitigation practices (e.g., energy structure reform, technology innovation) could largely offset these trends by reducing demand and enhancing supply. At the watershed scale, the spatially inhomogeneous responses to future changes suggest that regional water connectivity could significantly buffer the potential stress escalations due to the redistribution of water resources and diverse changes in consumptive uses and water supplies in different source areas. However, the detrimental future changes (e.g., depleting river discharges, larger demands of water withdrawal) may aggravate conflicts over water rights among regions and challenge our current water infrastructure system. This study provides new insights into the critical role of regional water connectivity in water supply security, and highlights the increasing need for integrated monitoring and management of water resources at various spatial levels in a changing world.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3ainfrastructure 3amonitoring 3apopulation growth 3astream flow 3asurface water 3atopography 3awater management 3awater rights 3awater stress 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aUnited States 0aWater stress 0aWater connectivity 0aClimate change 0aUpstream flow 0aWater transfer 0aWater consumption1 aCaldwell, Peter V.eauthoruCoweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, USDA Forest Service, Otto, NC, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0537-35461 aSun, GeeauthoruEastern Forest Environmental Threat Assessment Center, USDA Forest Service, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0159-13701 aMcNulty, Steven G.eauthoruEastern Forest Environmental Threat Assessment Center, USDA Forest Service, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4518-56461 aZhang, YangeauthoruDepartment of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA1 aShuster, ErikeauthoruNational Energy Technology Laboratory, US Department of Energy, Pittsburgh, PA, USA1 aLiu, BingjuneauthoruSchool of Civil Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China1 aBolstad, Paul V.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Resources, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, USA0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 Mar., v. 570 p.80-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4653940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46539b0022-1694c570e80  fJournal of hydrology  aBatch:2138  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6062893549ExL  a2019-05-16  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/18838-00001-HEAD-ONLY-REVISEDSUBJECTLIST.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0022169419300290.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6289354  a2019-05-16  a2019-05-1601865nab a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003400098024003700132035002800169040001800197100005400215245015700269506007600426506003100502592002800533596004700561506003700608700006900645700006000714700005200774700004600826700005400872773006200926856008100988912001201069914003601081917001101117918002701128935002201155955003401177961001301211962001701224974001701241979001601258984001501274985010601289990002401395991561042100742620221207112743.0220901e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074027592DNAL7 a10.1177/09636625209666902doi7 a10.1177/09636625209666902chorus  aagid:7402759-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGetson, Jackie M.eauthoruPurdue University, USA10aDo scientists have a responsibility to provide climate change expertise to mitigation and adaptation strategies?

Here we show that grid-based simulations, point-based simulations, and statistical regressions produce similar estimates of temperature impact on wheat yields at global and national scales. With a 1°C global temperature increase, global wheat yield is projected to decline by between 4.1% and 6.0%, a relatively narrow range considering the different methods used. Projected temperature impacts from different methods were very similar for major wheat producing countries China, India, USA and France, but less so for Russia. At the location scale, the point-based method simulated higher responses to temperature than the grid-based method. Specifically, the point-based method tended to predict more yield loss with increasing temperature at cooler locations and less yield loss at warmer locations. However, both point-based and grid-based simulations, and to some extent the statistical regressions, were consistent in predicting that warmer regions are likely to suffer more yield reductions with increasing temperature than cooler regions. By forming a multi-method ensemble, it was possible to quantify 'method uncertainty' in addition to model uncertainty. Use of multi-methods model ensembles should significantly improves the accuracy of estimates of climate impacts on global food security.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article  a1027brdonahuec2017-02-01dcmartineze2017-02-09  eARIS manuscript 3aTriticum aestivum 3aclimate 3afood security 3aglobal warming 3agrain yield 3amodel uncertainty 3aprediction 3atemperature 3awheat 3aChina 3aFrance 3aIndia 3aRussia 3aUnited States0 tNature Climate Change.g2016 Sept. 12, v. 6, no. 12 p.1130-1136wSource:1x1758-678X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/631433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NCLIMATE31153Available from publisher's site  aArticle  fNature Climate Change  aBatch:1544  aissued  aIND6000631439ExL  a2017-02-22  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Liu%20Asseng%202016%20climate%20change%20wheat%20yields%20productivity%20modeling.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aMissing ISSN  aBatch:1544 reviewed on 2017-02-22T15:00:02Z  aagid:63143  aArticle missing volume number  a2016-09-16  a2017-02-22  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans1135504524nab a2200649 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098024002200136024001900158035002800177040001800205100018000223245012200403246005200525506007600577520193100653592002802584593001802612506003702630650001302667650002002680650001902700650002102719650002302740650002202763650001302785650001102798650001902809650001202828650001602840651001702856700017702873700018903050700006003239773007303299787003303372787001803405787002403423856008403447912001203531914004003543914001303583916001503596917001103611918004603622935002203668949001503690953001703705961001203722962004503734962004803779974001703827983001503844984001503859991561152770742620221207112749.0150316e20130415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012162212DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00619542doi7 aPMC36266372pmcid7 a235965322pmid  aagid:1216221-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hong-XiangeauthoruKey Laboratory of Biogeography and Bioresource in Arid Land, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China10aRetreating or Standing: Responses of Forest Species and Steppe Species to Climate Change in Arid Eastern Central Asia3 aPlants Response to Climate Change in Arid Lands  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe temperature in arid Eastern Central Asia is projected to increase in the future, accompanied by increased variability of precipitation. To investigate the impacts of climate change on plant species in this area, we selected two widespread species as candidates, Clematis sibirica and C. songorica, from montane coniferous forest and arid steppe habitats respectively. We employed a combined approach of molecular phylogeography and species distribution modelling (SDM) to predict the future responses of these two species to climate change, utilizing evidence of responses from the past. Genetic data for C. sibirica shows a significant phylogeographical signal (N ST > F ST , P <0.05) and demographic contraction during the glacial-interglacial cycles in the Pleistocene. This forest species would likely experience range reduction, though without genetic loss, in the face of future climate change. In contrast, SDMs predict that C. songorica , a steppe species, should maintain a consistently stable potential distribution under the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the future climatic conditions referring to its existing potential distribution. Molecular results indicate that the presence of significant phylogeographical signal in this steppe species is rejected and this species contains a high level of genetic differentiation among populations in cpDNA, likely benefiting from stable habitats over a lengthy time period. Evidence from the molecular phylogeography of these two species, the forest species is more sensitive to past climate changes than the steppe species. SDMs predict that the forest species will face the challenge of potential range contraction in the future more than the steppe species. This provides a perspective on ecological management in arid Eastern Central Asia, indicating that increased attention should be paid to montane forest species, due to their high sensitivity to disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClematis 3achloroplast DNA 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aconiferous forests 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aphylogeography 3asteppes 3atemperature 3aCentral Asia1 aZhang, Ming-LieauthoruKey Laboratory of Biogeography and Bioresource in Arid Land, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China1 aSanderson, Stewart C.eauthoruShrub Sciences Laboratory, Intermountain Research Station, Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Provo, Utah, United States of America1 aCaramelli, DavideEditoruUniversity of Florence, Italy0 tPloS one.g, v. 8, no. 4dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl427719840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00619543Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4277198b1932-6203c8d4  fPloS one  aBatch:1160  aissued2 aPublic Library of Scienceeprovider5DNAL  aIND6012162219ExL  a2020-03-06  aPLOS_XML.zip  aUSDA/FS  aIncludes JATS article full-text content.  aBatch:1160 reviewed on 2016-01-06T15:00:02Z  aagid:1216221  a2015-03-16  a2020-03-0603560nab a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100019500180245009200375300001600467500001900483520125200502592002801754593001801782596006501800650003101865650001601896650001901912650002301931650002201954650001601976650001601992650001302008651002602021700014202047700015102189773010602340787003302446787001802479787002202497856008202519912001202601914004402613914001302657916001602670917001102686918002902697935002202726949001502748953006702763954005602830955003702886961001202923974001702935983001502952984001502967991561532760742620221118231057.0200604e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069732382DNAL7 a10.1007/s13157-019-01183-62doi  aagid:6973238-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVepraskas, M.

The DRAINMOD hydrologic model was used to compute daily water table levels over two time periods: 1983–2012 (current conditions) and 2041–2070 (future conditions). For each site and time period, the model simulated water table depths for a soil pedon (Typic Paleaquult) that previous work demonstrated was on the wetland-hydrology boundary. Results for the Pitt County site in NC showed that by 2070 the wetland-hydrology boundary would have moved “downhill” to a point that was approximately 17 cm lower in elevation than where the boundary was in 2012 due to a 20% increase in evapotranspiration. Similar analyses were done for hypothetical wetland soils in Miami FL, Easton MD, and Portland ME where the wetland hydrology boundaries were estimated to drop in elevation by 5, 10 and 25 cm, respectively. Our results demonstrated that climate change may have significant impact on wetland boundaries.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aNRCS-05-100-TDCcUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aPaleaquults 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic models 3atemperature 3awater table 3awetlands 3aEastern United States1 aSkaggs, R.

The adoption of a process-based model was necessary due to the lack of long-term observed data. Our goals were to calibrate the WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) model for different land uses under subtropical conditions in the Cerrado biome; predict runoff and soil erosion for these different land uses; and simulate runoff and soil erosion considering climate change. We performed the model calibration using a 5-year dataset (2012–2016) of observed runoff and soil loss in four different land uses (wooded Cerrado, tilled fallow without plant cover, pasture, and sugarcane) in experimental plots. Selected soil and management parameters were optimized for each land use during the WEPP model calibration with the existing field data. The simulations were conducted using the calibrated WEPP model components with a 100-year climate dataset created with CLIGEN (weather generator) based on regional climate statistics. We obtained downscaled General Circulation Model (GCM) projections, and runoff and soil loss were predicted with WEPP using future climate scenarios for 2030, 2060, and 2090 considering different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The WEPP model had an acceptable performance for the subtropical conditions. Land use can influence runoff and soil loss rates in a significant way. Potential climate changes, which indicate the increase of rainfall intensities and depths, may increase the variability and rates of runoff and soil erosion. However, projected climate changes did not significantly affect the runoff and soil erosion for the four analyzed land uses at our location. Finally, the runoff behavior was distinct for each land use, but for soil loss we found similarities between pasture and wooded Cerrado, suggesting that the soil may attain a sustainable level when the land management follows conservation principles.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aWater Erosion Prediction Project 3acerrado 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afallow 3aland use 3apastures 3arain intensity 3arunoff 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3astatistics 3asugarcane 3atopographic slope 3awater conservation 3aBrazil 0aOverland flow 0aSoil loss 0aWEPP model 0aPasture 0aSugarcane 0aWoodlands1 aFlanagan, Dennis C.eauthoruUSDA-Agricultural Research Service, National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory, 275 S.

The simulations dynamically downscaled data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data, Climate Forecast System (CFS) Version 2 and the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), to investigate irrigation effects on temperatures and surface fluxes under current and future scenarios in Southern Idaho. This study implements irrigation schemes within the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) 3.4 at a 4-km resolution to diagnose irrigation-induced changes to surface energy fluxes and boundary layer properties. Our results suggest that induced cooling via evaporation causes a decrease of 0.8°C to the air temperature over April − October, a decrease of up to 90m of the planetary boundary layer depth and an increase of 2.0°C in the dew point over the irrigated areas. On average, the growing season start date trends 0.46days/year earlier and the growing season termination date trends 0.60days/year later. A decrease in precipitation with time is also seen at all elevation ranges from the year 2040–2070, with the lowest elevation levels seeing a bigger decrease than the higher levels. Thus, irrigation-induced increases in growing degree days and modifications to surface fluxes are shown in the basin and it is critical to consider when planning both crop and water management.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000064350 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair temperature 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adewpoint 3aenergy flow 3aevaporation 3agrowing season 3aheat sums 3airrigated farming 3airrigation management 3aland 3amodels 3aplanning 3atroposphere 3awater resources 3aIdaho 0aIrrigation 0aSurface fluxes 0aClimate change 0aModeling1 aAnderson, Korri A.eauthoruNational Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, United States0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 234-235 p.66-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4325040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.12.0093Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5603640  aArticle  aJournal:jnl43250b0168-1923c234-235e66  fAgricultural and forest meteorology  aBatch:1614  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6056036409ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00033-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0168192316307286.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1873-2240  aMissing ISSN  aagid:5603640  a2019-03-18  a2022-09-0204171nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098024003600137035002800173040001800201100010000219245012900319300001600448506007600464506003100540520127900571592002801850593001801878596008301896506003701979650001502016650001902031650001402050650001102064650002102075650001602096650001002112651003102122653001902153653001502172653002502187653002402212653003002236700010202266700010102368700009002469700012002559773012402679787003302803787001802836787002202854856008302876912001202959914004202971914004203013916001503055917001103070918003603081935002203117949001503139953009103154954006103245955003503306961000903341962004703350962001703397974001703414983001503431984001503446991561854880742620221215142405.0200503e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056548302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2017.03.0172chorus7 a10.1016/j.agee.2017.03.0172doi  aagid:5654830-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntle, John M.eauthoruDepartment of Applied Economics, Oregon State University, United States10aMethods to assess between-system adaptations to climate change: Dryland wheat systems in the Pacific Northwest United States  ap. 195-207.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aIn this paper we propose to extend methods for agricultural impact assessment to study the adaptations that agricultural producers are likely to consider in response to climate change – i.e., the use of different combinations of crop or livestock species and associated changes in management. Analysis of these kinds of adaptations, referred to here as “between-system adaptations” – requires estimates of the counterfactual productivity and cost of production for prospective systems that are not observable in the locations where they could be used. We propose two methods that we call simulation matching and propensity score matching. We apply and compare the results of these methods in a study of wheat-based systems in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. We find substantial differences between the two methods, but these differences do not appear to be systematic or associated with characteristics of the systems. We conclude that the method used for estimating the productivity of the new system introduces an element of uncertainty into adaptation analysis, in addition to the other data, model and scenario uncertainties. Further research is warranted to evaluate alternative methods for analysis of between-system adaptations and their associated uncertainties.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarid lands 3aclimate change 3alivestock 3amodels 3aproduction costs 3auncertainty 3awheat 3aNorthwestern United States 0aClimate change 0aAdaptation 0aDryland wheat system 0aSimulation matching 0aPropensity score matching1 aZhang, HongliangeauthoruDepartment of Applied Economics, Oregon State University, United States1 aMu, Jianhong E.eauthoruDepartment of Applied Economics, Oregon State University, United States1 aAbatzoglou, JohneauthoruDepartment of Geography, University of Idaho, United States1 aStöckle, ClaudioeauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State University, United States0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2018 Feb. 1, v. 253 p.195-207dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl3470940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl34709b0167-8809c253e195  fAgriculture, ecosystems & environment  aBatch:1716  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6056548309ExL  a2019-03-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/122279531279841237-00002-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0167880917301391.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 0167-8809  aMissing ISSN  aagid:5654830  a2020-05-03  a2022-09-0203734nab a2200637 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002400098035002800122040001800150100011500168245008600283300001800369500002000387520146900407592002801876593001801904650001201922650001101934650001701945650001201962650001901974650001501993650001202008650001302020650001102033650002802044650001502072650001602087650001502103650000902118651001502127700011302142700012502255700011602380773013202496787003302628787001802661787002202679856007002701912001202771914004502783914002802828916001502856917001102871918004302882935002202925949001502947953002702962961001202989962004803001974001703049983001503066984001503081991561855100742620221118233855.0180102e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058752592DNAL7 a10.1890/0252952doi  aagid:5875259-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLenihan, James M.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Corvallis, Oregon 97731 USA10aClimate change effects on vegetation distribution, carbon, and fire in california  ap. 1667-1681.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study was to dynamically simulate the response of vegetation distribution, carbon, and fire to the historical climate and to two contrasting scenarios of climate change in California. The results of the simulations for the historical climate compared favorably to independent estimates and observations, but validation of the results was complicated by the lack of land use effects in the model. The response to increasing temperatures under both scenarios was characterized by a shift in dominance from needle‐leaved to broad‐leaved life‐forms and by increases in vegetation productivity, especially in the relatively cool and mesic regions of the state. The simulated response to changes in precipitation were complex, involving not only the effect of changes in soil moisture on vegetation productivity, but also changes in tree–grass competition mediated by fire. Summer months were warmer and persistently dry under both scenarios, so the trends in simulated fire area under both scenarios were primarily a response to changes in vegetation biomass. Total ecosystem carbon increased under both climate scenarios, but the proportions allocated to the wood and grass carbon pools differed. The results of the simulations underscore the potentially large impact of climate change on California ecosystems, and the need for further use and development of dynamic vegetation models using various ensembles of climate change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3aland use 3amodels 3apopulation distribution 3asoil water 3atemperature 3avegetation 3awood 3aCalifornia1 aDrapek, RaymondeauthoruUSDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Corvallis, Oregon 97731 USA1 aBachelet, DominiqueeauthoruDepartment of Bioresource Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon 97331 USA1 aNeilson, Ronald P.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Corvallis, Oregon 97731 USA0 tEcological applications.g2003 Dec., v. 13, no. 6 p.1667-1681dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4719340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0252953Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl47193b1051-0761c13d6e1667  fEcological applications  aBatch:1909  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058752599ExL  a2018-03-01  a10510761_2003_13_6.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1909 reviewed on 2018-03-01T15:00:03Z  aagid:5875259  a2018-01-02  a2018-03-0104654nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100013500179245015700314300001600471520189700487592002802384593001802412650001002430650001502440650002902455650001102484650002502495650001302520650001902533650001002552650002202562650002202584650003102606650001202637650002302649650001202672651002602684700011302710700011202823700015402935700015403089700011403243773009903357787003303456787001803489787002203507856008203529912001203611914004403623914001503667916001403682917001103696918002903707935002203736949001503758953006703773954005603840955003703896961001203933974001703945983001503962984001503977991561927830742620221118234818.0210615e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012152972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-014-9822-02doi  aagid:1215297-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZolkos, Scott G.eauthoruWoods Hole Research Center, 149 Woods Hole Road, Falmouth, Massachusetts, 02540, USA. zolkos@ualberta.ca10aProjected Tree Species Redistribution Under Climate Change: Implications for Ecosystem Vulnerability Across Protected Areas in the Eastern United States  ap. 202-220.  aThe degree to which tree species will shift in response to climate change is uncertain yet critical to understand for assessing ecosystem vulnerability. We analyze results from recent studies that model potential tree species habitat across the eastern United States during the coming century. Our goals were to quantify and spatially analyze habitat projections and their congruence under multiple climate scenarios and to assess the implications of habitat change for forest vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in and around protected areas. We assessed habitat projections of species habitat extent and forest composition for 35 tree species under climate change from 2000 to 2100 within National Park Service management units in the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative (ALCC), spanning an approximately 1,500 km latitudinal gradient. Our results show that forest composition and species ranges could change substantially under all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and that model correspondence was stronger for projections of habitat declines than increases. Model correspondence generally increased at finer spatial scales, but varied by tree species and focal area. In the ALCC, forest composition was projected to change the most in protected area centered ecosystems (PACEs). Northeastern PACEs were projected to be suitable for tree species currently in southeastern PACEs, suggesting that intermediate suitable habitat regions could promote tree species persistence and mitigate the impacts of climate change on eastern forests. These results suggest that climate-specific management of eastern U.S. forest ecosystems will be critical but challenging, requiring integrated assessment and management of PACEs and protected areas as well as higher-resolution monitoring and modeling to inform spatially explicit management decisions within eastern U.S. parks.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aparks 3amonitoring 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3alandscape management 3ahabitats 3aclimate change 3atrees 3aspecies diversity 3aforest ecosystems 3aU.S. National Park Service 3aclimate 3aconservation areas 3aforests 3aEastern United States1 aJantz, PatrickeauthoruWoods Hole Research Center, 149 Woods Hole Road, Falmouth, Massachusetts, 02540, USA1 aCormier, TinaeauthoruWoods Hole Research Center, 149 Woods Hole Road, Falmouth, Massachusetts, 02540, USA1 aIverson, Louis R.eauthoruLandscape Change Research Group, Northern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 359 Main Road, Delaware, Ohio, 43015, USA1 aMcKenney, Daniel W.eauthoruCanadian Forest Service, Great Lakes Forestry Centre, 1219 Queen Street East, Sault Ste.

Yet, the way that climate change may alter regeneration is unclear. We developed a quantitative framework that estimates forest regeneration potential (RP) as a function of key environmental conditions for ponderosa pine, a key dryland forest species. We integrated meteorological data and climate projections for 47 ponderosa pine forest sites across the western United States, and evaluated RP using an ecosystem water balance model. Our primary goal was to contrast conditions supporting regeneration among historical, mid‐21st century and late‐21st century time frames. Future climatic conditions supported 50% higher RP in 2020–2059 relative to 1910–2014. As temperatures increased more substantially in 2060–2099, seedling survival decreased, RP declined by 50%, and the frequency of years with very low RP increased from 25% to 58%. Thus, climate change may initially support higher RP and increase the likelihood of successful regeneration events, yet will ultimately reduce average RP and the frequency of years with moderate climate support of regeneration. Our results suggest that climate change alone may begin to restrict the persistence and expansion of dryland forests by limiting seedling survival in the late 21st century.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3ameteorological data 3aarid lands 3aseedlings 3amodels 3aconiferous forests 3aPinus ponderosa 3aclimate change 3atrees 3aforest regeneration 3aecosystems 3atemperature 3aclimatic factors 3aWestern United States 0awater balance1 aBradford, J.

We present the results from the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) model comparison study on European climate policy to 2050. Moving from a no-policy scenario to an existing-policies case reduces all energy imports, on average. Introducing a more stringent climate policy target for the EU only leads to slightly greater global emission reductions. Consumers and producers in Europe bear most of the additional burden and inevitably face some economic losses. More ambitious mitigation action outside Europe, especially when paired with a well-operating global carbon market, could reduce the burden for Europe significantly. Because of global learning, the costs of wind and especially solar-PV in Europe would decline below the levels observed in the existing-policy case and increased R&D spending outside the EU would leverage EU R&D investments as well.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon markets 3aclimate 3acost analysis 3aenergy 3aimports 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3amodels 3awind 3aEurope1 aKeppo, Ilkkaeauthor1 aBollen, Johanneseauthor1 aCarrara, Samueleauthor1 aForester, Hannaheauthor1 aHubler, Michaeleauthor1 aKanudia, Amiteauthor1 aPaltsev, Sergeyeauthor1 aSands, Ronald D.eauthor1 aSchumacher, Katjaeauthor0 tClimate change economics.g2013, v. 4dSingapore World ScientificwJournal:28338x2010-00867nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)2833840uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/584533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S2010007813400022  aArticle  aJournal:28338b2010-0086c4  fClimate change economics  aissued  aIND5007345439ExL  a2021-06-22  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/de%20Cian_CCE_November-2013.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:462 annotated on 2014-03-04T08:30:43Z  aBatch:462 reviewed on 2014-03-19T16:00:05Z  aBatch:462 reviewed on 2014-03-20T04:00:05Z  aagid:58453  a2014-02-18  a2020-10-06  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans406605958nab a2200973 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002100115024003600136024001100172035002600183040001800209100017300227245008500400300001400485500001500499506017300514520215100687592002802838593001802866593002002884650002402904650002102928650000802949650002002957650000902977650001602986650001303002650002103015650001103036650001203047650002603059650001903085650002003104650001103124650001903135650002203154650002003176650002203196650001203218651001403230653002403244653001503268653001903283653002203302653002403324653002303348653002203371653002003393700011503413700009203528700010103620700011803721773012303839787003303962787001803995787003004013787002204043856008304065856011204148912001204260914003004272914004204302917001104344918003604355935002204391949001504413953006004428954006104488955003504549956008604584961001304670962003004683962004804713962004704761962004704808962007304855974001504928983001504943984001504958986001104973991562024400742620221214223802.0190318e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007345482DNAL7 a2959532aris7 a10113/584672hdl7 a10.1016/j.agee.2014.01.0042doi8 ans4079  aagid:58467-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarshall, N.A.eauthoruCSIRO Ecosystem Sciences and School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, James Cook University, University Drive, Townsville QLD 4811, Australia10aSocial vulnerability to climate change in primary producers: A typology approach  ap. 86-93.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aAdaptation of agricultural industries to climate change will make a major difference to the extent of the impacts experienced as a result of climate change. Vulnerability assessments provide the basis for developing strategies to reduce social vulnerability and plan for climate adaptation. Primary industries have been identified as the most vulnerable industry sector globally. We review how primary producers might be socially vulnerable to climate change and develop a ‘vulnerability typology’ of cattle producers based on survey responses from 240 producers across northern Australia. We measured social vulnerability according to ten indicators of climate sensitivity (resource dependency) and four indicators of adaptive capacity. Using a K-means clustering analysis we identified four main ‘types’ of cattle producers. Type 1 producers (43%) were vulnerable because they had low strategic skills and low interest in changing behaviour. Mean age was 59 years old, they were weakly networked within the industry and businesses were small. Type II producers (41%) had low strategic skills, poorly managed risk and uncertainty, had medium sized businesses and were 51 years old on average. Only 16% of producers (Type III and IV) appeared to have resilience to change. Type III producers (13.4%) had a stronger psychological and financial buffer, were 52 years old on average, were well networked and managed or owned larger businesses. Type IV producers (2.6%) managed risk well, liked to experiment with options and were interested in change. They were 41 years old on average, managed extremely large properties, were well networked, perceived themselves as responsible for the future productivity of their land and were early adopters of new technology. By providing knowledge of the different ways in which people can be vulnerable to climate change, vulnerability assessments can enable decision-makers to prioritise their efforts, provide a basis for early engagement, and tailor a range of adaptation approaches to most effectively accommodate and support the divergent requirements of different “types” of resource-users.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3ainnovation adoption 3acluster analysis 3aage 3adecision making 3arisk 3auncertainty 3aindustry 3asmall businesses 3apeople 3aclimate 3atrophic relationships 3aagroecosystems 3arisk management 3acattle 3aclimate change 3acattle production 3aself-perception 3aland productivity 3asurveys 3aAustralia 0aResource dependency 0atechnology 0anew technology 0aSocial resilience 0aClimate sensitivity 0aBarriers to change 0aAdaptive capacity 0aClimate impacts1 aStokes, C.J.eauthoruCSIRO Ecosystem Sciences, Based at James Cook University, Townsville QLD 4811, Australia1 aWebb, N.P.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM 88003-8003, USA1 aMarshall, P.A.eauthoruGreat Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Townsville QLD 4810, Australia1 aLankester, A.J.eauthoruCSIRO Ecosystem Sciences, Based at James Cook University, Townsville QLD 4811, Australia0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 186 p.86-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl3470940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.01.0043Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/584673Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl34709c186e86  fAgriculture, ecosystems & environment  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND5007345489ExL  a2019-03-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00030-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0167880914000097.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/14-002.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:462 annotated on 2014-03-04T08:30:43Z  aBatch:462 reviewed on 2014-03-19T16:00:05Z  aBatch:462 reviewed on 2014-03-20T04:00:05Z  aJournal title changed from 'Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment'  aagid:58467  a2019-03-18  a2019-03-18  ans407904565nab a2200841 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002100098024002800119024001100147035002600158040001800184100003000202245008500232300001500317506017300332520155200505593001802057593002002075594002202095650001902117650002302136650001302159650001102172650002002183650001602203650001002219650001602229700004302245700002702288700002602315700003002341700002902371700002502400700002702425700002302452700003402475700003002509700003502539700002802574700003002602700002502632700003102657700002902688700003102717700002802748700003102776700002402807700003102831773009702862787003302959787001802992787002203010856011203032856004103144912001203185914004303197914002703240917001103267935002203278949001503300956010203315961000903417962003003426962004803456962004703504974001503551983001503566984001503581985011603596986001103712991562024790742620221118232707.0140218e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007214582DNAL7 a10113/584612hdl7 a10.1111/agec.120912doi8 ans4068  aagid:58461-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Gerald C.eauthor10aAgriculture and climate change in global scenarios: why don’t the models agree  ap. 85-101.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aAgriculture is unique among economic sectors in the nature of impacts from climate change. The production activity that transforms inputs into agricultural outputs involves direct use of weather inputs (temperature, solar radiation available to the plant, and precipitation). Previous studies of the impacts of climate change on agriculture have reported substantial differences in outcomes such as prices, production, and trade arising from differences in model inputs and model specification. This article presents climate change results and underlying determinants from a model comparison exercise with 10 of the leading global economic models that include significant representation of agriculture. By harmonizing key drivers that include climate change effects, differences in model outcomes were reduced. The particular choice of climate change drivers for this comparison activity results in large and negative productivity effects. All models respond with higher prices. Producer behavior differs by model with some emphasizing area response and others yield response. Demand response is least important. The differences reflect both differences in model specification and perspectives on the future. The results from this study highlight the need to more fully compare the deep model parameters, to generate a call for a combination of econometric and validation studies to narrow the degree of uncertainty and variability in these parameters and to move to Monte Carlo type simulations to better map the contours of economic uncertainty.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article 3aclimate change 3aeconometric models 3aexercise 3aprices 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3atrade 3auncertainty1 avan der Mensbrugghe, Dominiqueeauthor1 aAhammad, Helaleauthor1 aBlanc, Elodieeauthor1 aCalvin, Katherineeauthor1 aHasegawa, Tomokoeauthor1 aHavlik, Petreauthor1 aHeyhoe, Edwinaeauthor1 aKyle, Pageeauthor1 aLotze-Campen, Hermanneauthor1 avon Lampe, Martineauthor1 aMason d’Croz, Danieleauthor1 avan Meijl, Hanseauthor1 aMuller, Christopheauthor1 aReilly, Johneauthor1 aRobertson, Richardeauthor1 aSands, Ronald D.eauthor1 aSchmitz, Christopheauthor1 aTabeau, Andrzejeauthor1 aTakahashi, Kiyoshieauthor1 aValin, Hugoeauthor1 aWillenbockel, Dirkeauthor0 tAgricultural economics.g2014 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.85-101wJournal:jnl41636x1574-08627nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4163640uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/584613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/agec.12091  aArticle  aJournal:jnl41636b0169-5150c45d1e85  fAgricultural economics  aissued  aIND5007214589ExL  a2014-03-14  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Nelson_AE_January-2014.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:461 annotated on 2014-03-04T08:25:03Z  aBatch:461 reviewed on 2014-03-14T11:00:04Z  aagid:58461  a2014-02-18  a2014-02-28  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans406803650nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002100098024003500119024001100154035002600165040001800191100002800209245011500237506017300352520113200525593001801657593002001675650001101695650001901706650001601725650001401741650002201755650001101777650001301788650002101801650001901822651001101841700003001852700002801882700002801910700002501938700002601963700002901989773010702018787003302125787001802158787003002176787001902206856011202225856004802337912001202385914003202397914002902429917001102458935002202469949001502491956010502506961000902611962003002620962004802650962004702698962004702745974001502792983001502807984001502822985011602837986001102953991562042570742620221118232528.0140218e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007345442DNAL7 a10113/584562hdl7 a10.1142/S20100078134000462doi8 ans4067  aagid:58456-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForster, Hannaheauthor10aEuropean Energy Efficiency and Decarbonization Strategies Beyond 2030 – A Sectoral Multi-Model Decomposition  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aEnergy efficiency and decarbonization are important elements of climate change mitigation. We draw on European mitigation scenarios from the EMF28 modeling exercise to decompose economy-wide and sectoral emissions into their main components. We utilize the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) to gain insights into five effects: affluence, energy intensity, carbon intensity, conversion efficiency, and structural change. Economy-wide analysis suggests that energy efficiency improvements (including end-use efficiency of production and structural change of the economy) determine emission reductions short to medium term while decarbonization becomes more important in the long term. Sectoral analysis suggests that electricity generation holds the largest potential for decarbonization. Mitigation in the transport and energy-intensive sectors is limited by technology availability, forcing output and energy inputs to decline to meet the given mitigation pathways. We conclude that energy efficiency improvements could bridge the time until carbon-free technologies mature, while their quick development remains essential.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3amodels 3aplanning 3apower generation 3atransportation 3aEurope1 aSchumacher, Katjaeauthor1 ade Cian, Enricaeauthor1 aHubler, Michaeleauthor1 aKeppo, Ilkkaeauthor1 aMimi, Silvanaeauthor1 aSands, Ronald D.eauthor0 tClimate change economics.g2013 Dec., v. 4dSingapore World ScientificwJournal:28338x2010-00867nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)2833840uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/584563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S2010007813400046  aArticle  aJournal:28338b2010-0086c4  fClimate change economics  aissued  aIND5007345449ExL  a2021-06-22  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Forster_CCE_December-2013.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:462 annotated on 2014-03-04T08:30:43Z  aBatch:462 reviewed on 2014-03-19T16:00:05Z  aBatch:462 reviewed on 2014-03-20T04:00:05Z  aagid:58456  a2014-02-18  a2020-10-06  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans406706005nab a2201165 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001900098024002200117024002100139024003300160024001100193035002600204040001800230100003000248245008400278300001800362506007600380506017300456520174700629592002802376593001802404593002002422594002202442506003702464650002202501650001502523650001902538650001202557650001902569650001602588650001002604650002302614650002402637650001302661650001102674650001502685650002702700650002902727650001902756650004202775650002402817650004602841650001602887650001102903650002102914653003002935653002602965653002602991653003003017700002403047700002903071700002603100700002703126700002903153700002803182700003303210700003003243700002703273700002303300700003003323700003403353700003503387700002803422700004303450700003103493700002803524700003103552700003003583700002603613700003103639700002803670700003103698773017203729787003303901787001803934787002203952856011203974856007904086912001204165914004604177914008404223917001104307918003504318935002204353949001504375953002904390956010204419961000904521962008104530962003004611962004804641962004704689962004704736974001504783983001504798984001504813986001104828991562088790742620221207083445.0150614e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007369622DNAL7 a243442852pmid7 aPMC39482952pmcid7 a10113/585502hdl7 a10.1073/pnas.12224651102doi8 ans4204  aagid:58550-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Gerald C.eauthor10aClimate change effects on agriculture: Economic responses to biophysical shocks  ap. 3274-3279.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aAgricultural production is sensitive to weather and thus directly affected by climate change. Plausible estimates of these climate change impacts require combined use of climate, crop, and economic models. Results from previous studies vary substantially due to differences in models, scenarios, and data. This paper is part of a collective effort to systematically integrate these three types of models. We focus on the economic component of the assessment, investigating how nine global economic models of agriculture represent endogenous responses to seven standardized climate change scenarios produced by two climate and five crop models. These responses include adjustments in yields, area, consumption, and international trade. We apply biophysical shocks derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s representative concentration pathway with end-of-century radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m ². The mean biophysical yield effect with no incremental CO ₂ fertilization is a 17% reduction globally by 2050 relative to a scenario with unchanging climate. Endogenous economic responses reduce yield loss to 11%, increase area of major crops by 11%, and reduce consumption by 3%. Agricultural production, cropland area, trade, and prices show the greatest degree of variability in response to climate change, and consumption the lowest. The sources of these differences include model structure and specification; in particular, model assumptions about ease of land use conversion, intensification, and trade. This study identifies where models disagree on the relative responses to climate shocks and highlights research activities needed to improve the representation of agricultural adaptation responses to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3abiophysics 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop models 3acrops 3aeconometric models 3ainternational trade 3aland use 3aprices 3aweathering 2aAgriculturexeconomics 2aCarbon Dioxidexanalysis 2aClimate Change 2aCommercexstatistics & numerical data 2aComputer Simulation 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgrowth & development 2aForecasting 2aHumans 2aModels, Economic 0aclimate change adaptation 0amodel intercomparison 0aintegrated assessment 0aagricultural productivity1 aValin, Hugoeauthor1 aSands, Ronald D.eauthor1 aHavlík, Petreauthor1 aAhammad, Helaleauthor1 aDeryng, Delphineeauthor1 aElliott, Joshuaeauthor1 aFujimori, Shinichiroeauthor1 a Hasegawa, Tomokoeauthor1 aHeyhoe, Edwinaeauthor1 aKyle, Pageeauthor1 aVon Lampe, Martineauthor1 aLotze-Campen, Hermanneauthor1 aMason d’Croz, Danieleauthor1 avan Meijl, Hanseauthor1 avan der Mensbrugghe, Dominiqueeauthor1 aMüller, Christopheauthor1 aPopp, Alexandereauthor1 aRobertson, Richardeauthor1 aRobinson, Shermaneauthor1 aSchmid, Erwineauthor1 aSchmitz, Christopheauthor1 aTabeau, Andrzejeauthor1 aWillenbockel, Dirkeauthor0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 111, no. 9 p.3274-3279dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4568040uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/585503Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12224651103Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl45680b1091-6490c111d9e3274  fProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America  aissued2 aHighWire Presseprovider5DNAL  aIND5007369629ExL  a2014-03-27  apnas_111_9_nlmxml.tar.gz  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Nelson_PNAS_March-2014.pdf  aUSDA  aJournal title changed from 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:472 annotated on 2014-03-12T07:39:02Z  aBatch:472 reviewed on 2014-03-26T16:00:05Z  aBatch:472 reviewed on 2014-03-27T04:00:05Z  aagid:58550  a2015-06-14  a2015-06-14  ans420404509nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003700098035002800135040001800163100011900181245014300300520176700443592002802210593001802238650003102256650003702287650003002324650001202354650001902366650002502385650001102410650002502421650001502446650002002461650001302481650001102494650000902505650002202514650001702536651001302553653003302566653000902599700012602608700012302734700014202857700011302999773010803112787003303220787001803253787002203271856008403293912001203377914004003389914002803429916001603457917001103473918003603484935002203520949001503542952001903557953009103576954006103667955003503728961001303763974001703776983001503793984001503808991562168560742620221118233930.0220214e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076109222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2021.1052962doi  aagid:7610922-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, LifengeauthoruUSDA-Agricultural Research Service, Grazinglands Research Laboratory, El Reno, OK 73036, USA10aModeling surface runoff and soil loss response to climate change under GCM ensembles and multiple cropping and tillage systems in Oklahoma  aTo develop effective conservation practices to respond to future climatic challenges, the effects of various cropping and tillage systems on surface runoff and soil loss need to be evaluated under extensive geographical conditions. This study used a total of 100 climate scenarios generated from 25 downscaled General Circulation Model (GCM) projections under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and 8.5) during 2021–2050 and 2051–2080. Those 100 future scenarios were combined with 29 cropping and tillage systems to simulate surface runoff, soil erosion, and crop production response to climate change using the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model. The results showed that average annual precipitation in central Oklahoma was projected to significantly decrease by 4–6% (p < 0.05) during the two time periods for both RCP scenarios. Mean annual temperatures were projected to significantly increase (p < 0.01) by 1.74 ℃ for RCP4.5 and 1.99 ℃ for RCP8.5 during 2021–2050, and 2.65 ℃ for RCP4.5 and 3.90 ℃ for RCP8.5 during 2051–2080. Annual runoff and soil loss averaged over the two RCPs and all crop types was projected to decrease by approximately 1% and 3%, respectively. Except for cotton, crop yields were predicted to decrease by 10.3%–18.3% during 2021–2080. Simulated annual runoff depth and soil loss separately followed the order of reduced tillage (RT) > delayed tillage (DT) > no-till (NT) > conventional tillage (CT) and RT > CT > DT > NT under future climate scenarios, respectively. If economically feasible, no-till and the crop-alfalfa rotation were the most effective soil conservation method on farmlands to combat projected future erosion due to changing precipitation and temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aWater Erosion Prediction Project 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconventional tillage 3acotton 3aeconomic feasibility 3ano-tillage 3areduced tillage 3aresearch 3arunoff 3asoil 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion 3aOklahoma 0aCropping and tillage systems 0aWEPP1 aZhang, X.-C.

However, human activities have increased the supply of biologically limiting nutrients, and changed the density and identity of mammalian herbivores. These anthropogenic changes may alter net soil N mineralization (soil net Nₘᵢₙ), that is, the net balance between N mineralization and immobilization, which could severely impact grassland structure and functioning. Yet, to date, little is known about how fertilization and herbivore removal individually, or jointly, affect soil net Nₘᵢₙ across a wide range of grasslands that vary in soil and climatic properties. Here we collected data from 22 grasslands on five continents, all part of a globally replicated experiment, to assess how fertilization and herbivore removal affected potential (laboratory‐based) and realized (field‐based) soil net Nₘᵢₙ. Herbivore removal in the absence of fertilization did not alter potential and realized soil net Nₘᵢₙ. However, fertilization alone and in combination with herbivore removal consistently increased potential soil net Nₘᵢₙ. Realized soil net Nₘᵢₙ, in contrast, significantly decreased in fertilized plots where herbivores were removed. Treatment effects on potential and realized soil net Nₘᵢₙ were contingent on site‐specific soil and climatic properties. Fertilization effects on potential soil net Nₘᵢₙ were larger at sites with higher mean annual precipitation (MAP) and temperature of the wettest quarter (T.q.wet). Reciprocally, realized soil net Nₘᵢₙ declined most strongly with fertilization and herbivore removal at sites with lower MAP and higher T.q.wet. In summary, our findings show that anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, herbivore exclusion and alterations in future climatic conditions can negatively impact soil net Nₘᵢₙ across global grasslands under realistic field conditions. This is an important context‐dependent knowledge for grassland management worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cWSL  aNSF‐DEB‐1042132cNational Science Foundation Research Coordination Network  aNSF‐DEB‐1234162cLong‐Term Ecological Research (LTER) program  aDG‐0001‐13cInstitute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota  aFZT 118cGerman Research Foundation  cTERN Great Western Woodlands Supersite  aUIDB/00239/2020cCEF  cUSDA‐ARS 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aglobal change 3agrassland management 3agrasslands 3aherbivores 3ahumans 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3atemperature1 aZimmermann, StefaneauthoruSwiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Birmensdorf, Switzerland1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7085-02841 aMoser, BarbaraeauthoruSwiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Birmensdorf, Switzerland1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4305-71921 aSchütz, MartineauthoruSwiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Birmensdorf, Switzerland1 aHagedorn, FrankeauthoruSwiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Birmensdorf, Switzerland1 aFirn, JennifereauthoruSchool of Earth, Environmental and Biological Sciences, Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Qld, Australia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6026-89121 aFay, Philip A.eauthoruUSDA‐ARS Grassland, Soil, and Water Research Laboratory, Temple, TX, USA1 aAdler, Peter B.eauthoruDepartment of Wildland Resources and the Ecology Center, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA1 aBiederman, Lori A.eauthoruDepartment of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2171-78981 aBlair, John M.eauthoruDivision of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0072-07211 aBorer, Elizabeth T.eauthoruDepartment of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2259-58531 aBroadbent, Arthur A.

Arthropods are particularly at risk as temperature imposes physiological constraints on growth, survival, and reproduction. Given that arthropods may be disproportionately affected in a warmer climate—the question becomes which taxa are vulnerable and can we predict the supposed winners and losers of climate change? To address this question, we resurveyed 33 ant communities, quantifying 20‐yr differences in the incidence of 28 genera. Each North American ant community was surveyed with 30 1‐m² plots, and the incidence of each genus across the 30 plots was used to estimate change. From the original surveys in 1994–1997 to the resurveys in 2016–2017, temperature increased on average 1°C (range, −0.4°C to 2.5°C) and ~64% of ant genera increased in more than half of the sampled communities. To test Thermal Performance Theory's prediction that genera with higher average thermal limits will tend to accumulate at the expense of those with lower limits, we quantified critical thermal maxima (CTₘₐₓ: the high temperatures at which they lose muscle control) and minima (CTₘᵢₙ: the low temperatures at which ants first become inactive) for common genera at each site. Consistent with prediction, we found a positive decelerating relationship between CTₘₐₓ and the proportion of sites in which a genus had increased. CTₘᵢₙ, by contrast, was not a useful predictor of change. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.85) between the proportion of sites where a genus was found with higher incidence after 20 yr and the average difference in number of plots occupied per site, suggesting genera with high CTₘₐₓ values tended to occupy more plots at more sites after 20 yr. Thermal functional traits like CTₘₐₓ have thus proved useful in predicting patterns of long‐term community change in a dominant, diverse insect taxon.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a1550731cDivision of Environmental Biology  eARIS manuscript 3aFormicidae 3aair temperature 3aant colonies 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3ageographical variation 3aglobal warming 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ainsect surveys 3aNorth America1 aBujan, JelenaeauthoruDepartment of Biology, Geographical Ecology Group, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, 73019, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7938-02661 ade Beurs, Kirsten M.eauthoruDepartment of Geography and Environmental Sustainability, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, 73019, USA1 aWeiser, Michael D.eauthoruDepartment of Biology, Geographical Ecology Group, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, 73019, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9080-08341 aKaspari, MichaeleauthoruDepartment of Biology, Geographical Ecology Group, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, 73019, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9717-57680 tEcosphere.g2021 July, v. 12, no. 7 p.e03645-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1236340uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/74629043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.36453Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:12363b2150-8925c12d7ee03645  fEcosphere  aBatch:10177  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6074629049ExL  a2022-01-27  dgolden set  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/21508925_2021_12_7.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/21508925_2021_12_7.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/ARS  aARIS manuscript submission  aARIS Manuscript  aagid:7462904  a2021-07-30  a2022-01-2703458nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097035002700132040001800159100013100177245006600308300001400374500001500388520140300403592002801806593001801834650001701852650002001869650001001889650001301899650001601912650001601928650001601944650001901960650001801979650002001997650001502017650002102032650001902053653001502072700003202087700002902119700003702148700003202185773009102217787003302308787001802341787002102359856004802380912001202428914004502440914002002485917001102505918002902516935002102545949001502566951001502581953003402596961001302630962004802643962004702691974001602738983001502754984001502769986001202784991562939970742620221119114309.0131210e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444954342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-010-9879-52doi  aagid:426991-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiska, Lewis H.eauthoruCrop Systems and Global Change Laboratory, USDA-ARS, Beltsville, MD, 20705, USA, l.ziska@ars.usda.gov10aInvasive species and climate change: an agronomic perspective  ap. 13-42.  a2019-12-06  aIn the current review we wish to draw attention to an additional aspect of invasive species and climate change, that of agricultural productivity and food security. We recognize that at present, such a review remains, in part, speculative, and more illustrative than definitive. However, recent events on the global stage, particularly in regard to the number of food riots that occurred during 2008, even at a time of record harvests, have prompted additional interest in those factors, including invasive species, which could, through climatic uncertainty, alter food production. To that end, as agricultural scientists, we wish to begin an initial evaluation of key questions related to food production and climate change including: how vulnerable is agriculture to invasive species?; are current pest management strategies sufficient to control invasive outbreaks in the future?; what are the knowledge gaps?; can we provide initial recommendations for scientists, land managers and policy makers in regard to available resources? Our overall goals are to begin a synthesis of potential impacts on productivity, to identify seminal research areas that can be addressed in future research, and to provide the scientific basis to allow agronomists and land managers to formulate mitigation and adaptation options regarding invasive species and climate change as a means to maintain food security.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aharvest date 3apest management 3afoods 3amanagers 3aland policy 3auncertainty 3aagronomists 3aclimate change 3afood security 3afood production 3ascientists 3ainvasive species 3arisk reduction 0aadaptation1 aBlumenthal, Dana M.eauthor1 aRunion, G.

The contribution of each pathway to driver–productivity relationships depends on functional traits of dominant species. We used data from three experiments in Texas, USA, to assess the role of community dynamics in the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) response of C₄ grasslands to two climate drivers applied singly: atmospheric CO₂ enrichment and augmented summer precipitation. The ANPP-driver response differed among experiments because community responses and effects differed. ANPP increased by 80–120g m⁻² per 100 μl l⁻¹ rise in CO₂ in separate experiments with pasture and tallgrass prairie assemblages. Augmenting ambient precipitation by 128mm during one summer month each year increased ANPP more in native than in exotic communities in a third experiment. The community effect accounted for 21–38% of the ANPP CO₂ response in the prairie experiment but little of the response in the pasture experiment. The community response to CO₂ was linked to species traits associated with greater soil water from reduced transpiration (e.g. greater height). Community effects on the ANPP CO₂ response and the greater ANPP response of native than exotic communities to augmented precipitation depended on species differences in transpiration efficiency. These results indicate that feedbacks from community change influenced ANPP-driver responses. However, the species traits that regulated community effects on ANPP differed from the traits that determined how communities responded to drivers.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3agrasslands 3aplant communities 2aBiomass 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aClimate Change 2aDemography 2aGrassland 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aPoaceaexphysiology 2aWaterxphysiology 0aTexas 0aAtmospheric CO2 concentration 0aC4 perennial grassland 0aevapotranspiration 0aexotic plants 0aplant community composition 0apasture 0aprecipitation 0atallgrass prairie 0atranspiration efficiency 0awater-use efficiency.1 aDerner, Justin D.eauthoruUSDA-Agricultural Research Service, High Plains Grasslands Research Station, Cheyenne, Wyoming, 82009, USA1 aJackson, Robert B.eauthoruNicholas School of the Environment, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708, USA1 aWilsey, Brian J.eauthoruDepartment of Ecology, Evolution and Organismal Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 50011, USA1 aFay, Philip A.eauthoruUSDA–Agricultural Research Service, Grassland, Soil & Water Research Laboratory, Temple, Texas, 76502, USA0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 July, v. 65, no. 13 p.3415-3424dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4465840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru0093Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44658b0022-0957c65d13e3415  fJournal of experimental botany  aBatch:738  aissued2 aHighWire Presseprovider5DNAL  aIND6011891909ExL  a2014-12-29  ajexbot_65_13_nlmxml.tar.gz  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:738 annotated on 2014-12-08T12:07:50Z  aBatch:738 reviewed on 2014-12-29T11:00:02Z  aBatch:738 reviewed on 2014-12-29T16:00:02Z  aagid:1189190  a2014-11-27  a2014-11-2705102nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003100098035002800129040001800157100014300175245014500318300001600463520225700479592002802736593001802764650002002782650001902802650002002821650002602841650002202867650003002889650001502919650002802934650001102962650001002973650002402983651001803007653003003025653001403055653001603069653001703085653003203102700014503134700015203279700013503431700014103566773012403707787003303831787001803864787002403882856007703906912001203983914004603995914002304041916001504064917001104079918004404090935002204134949001504156953005304171954005004224955003504274961001204309962004804321974001704369983001504386984001504401991563218500742620221119132920.0191019e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067385662DNAL7 a10.1093/sysbio/syy0172doi  aagid:6738566-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaguire, Kaitlin CeauthoruU.S. Geological Survey, Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center, 970 S.

Thus, the need to model potential responses among genetically distinct populations within a species is increasingly recognized. However, predictive models of future distributions are regularly fit at the species level, often because intraspecific variation is unknown or is identified only within limited sample locations. In this study, we considered the role of intraspecific variation to shape the geographic distribution of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), an ecologically and economically important tree species in North America. Morphological and genetic variation across the distribution of ponderosa pine suggest the need to model intraspecific populations: the two varieties (var. ponderosa and var. scopulorum) and several haplotype groups within each variety have been shown to occupy unique climatic niches, suggesting populations have distinct evolutionary lineages adapted to different environmental conditions. We utilized a recently available, geographically widespread dataset of intraspecific variation (haplotypes) for ponderosa pine and a recently devised lineage distance modeling approach to derive additional, likely intraspecific occurrence locations. We confirmed the relative uniqueness of each haplotype-climate relationship using a niche-overlap analysis, and developed ecological niche models (ENMs) to project the distribution for two varieties and eight haplotypes under future climate forecasts. Future projections of haplotype niche distributions generally revealed greater potential range loss than predicted for the varieties. This difference may reflect intraspecific responses of distinct evolutionary lineages. However, directional trends are generally consistent across intraspecific levels, and include a loss of distributional area and an upward shift in elevation. Our results demonstrate the utility in modeling intraspecific response to changing climate and they inform management and conservation strategies, by identifying haplotypes and geographic areas that may be most at risk, or most secure, under projected climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aPinus ponderosa 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3aintraspecific variation 3aniches 3atrees 3aweather forecasting 3aNorth America 0aEcological niche modeling 0ahaplotype 0arange shift 0aconservation 0aclimate-plant relationships1 aShinneman, Douglas JeauthoruU.S. Geological Survey, Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center, 970 S.

Projections of water supply and demand over the 21st century show that in the absence of further adaptation efforts, serious water shortages are likely in some regions. Continued improvements in water use efficiency are likely but will be insufficient to avoid future shortages. Some adaptation measures that have been effective in the past, most importantly large additions to reservoir storage, have little promise. Other major adaptations commonly used in the past, especially instream flow removals and groundwater mining, can substantially lower shortages but have serious external costs. If those costs are to be avoided, transfers from irrigated agriculture probably will be needed and could be substantial.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cU.S. Forest Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3agroundwater 3airrigated farming 3apopulation growth 3astream flow 3asupply balance 3awater management 3awater use efficiency1 eauthoruStantec, Inc.

Using a finer ecological classification and fire‐relevant climate predictors, we created statistical models linking climate and wildfire area burned for ecosections, which are geographic delineations based on biophysical variables. The results indicate a gradient from purely fuel‐limited (antecedent positive water balance anomalies or negative energy balance anomalies) to purely flammability‐limited (negative water balance anomalies or positive energy balance anomalies) fire regimes across ecosections. Although there are other influences (such as human ignitions and management) on fire occurrence and area burned, seasonal climate significantly explains interannual fire area burned. Differences in the role of climate across ecosections are not random, and the relative dominance of climate predictors allows objective classification of ecosection climate‐fire relationships. Expected future trends in area burned range from massive increases, primarily in flammability limited systems near the middle of the water balance deficit distribution, to substantial decreases, in fuel‐limited nonforested systems. We predict increasing area burned in most flammability‐limited systems but predict decreasing area burned in primarily fuel‐limited systems with a flammability‐limited ("hybrid") component. Compared to 2030–2059 (2040s), projected area burned for 2070–2099 (2080s) increases much more in the flammability and flammability‐dominated hybrid systems than those with equal control and continues to decrease in fuel‐limited hybrid systems. Exceedance probabilities for historical 95th percentile fire years are larger in exclusively flammability‐limited ecosections than in those with fuel controls. Filtering the projected results using a fire‐rotation constraint minimizes overprojection due to static vegetation assumptions, making projections more conservative.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cJoint Fire Science Program  cJoint Fire Sciences Program  cRocky Mountain Research Station0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy balance 3aflammability 3ahumans 3avegetation 3awildfires1 aMcKenzie, DonaldeauthoruU.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, USA1 aWan, Ho YieauthoruSchool of Earth Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, Northern Arizona University, USA1 aCushman, Samuel A.eauthoruU.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, USA0 tEarth's Future.g2018 Aug., v. 6, no. 8 p.1097-1111dAmerican Geophysical Union (AGU)wJournal:21311x2328-42777nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2131140uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73385633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018ef0008783Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:21311c6d8e1097  fEarth's Future  aBatch:10189  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073385639ExL  a2022-05-02  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 2328-4277  aagid:7338563  a2022-09-01T12:42:20-04:00  a2022-09-26  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl05200nab a2200853 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098024001700137024002300154024003600177024002300213024004100236024002500277035002800302040001800330100017900348245013100527300001600658506007600674506003100750520086100781592002801642593001801670596004701688506003701735593002001772650001201792650001901804650001201823650001301835650001301848650001501861650002401876650002001900653001601920653001501936653001301951700015301964700012802117700013202245700017902377700019102556700020202747700017502949700021103124700015103335773009703486787003303583787001803616787001803634856008303652856011403735912001203849914004003861914001503901916001603916917001103932918003603943935002203979949001504001952001904016953009104035954006104126955003504187961000904222962003104231962002004262962001704282974001704299983001504316984001504331991563613730742620221214225605.0211030e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075247792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rala.2021.08.0042chorus7 a3830262aris7 a10113/75247792hdl7 a10.1016/j.rala.2021.08.0042doi7 a3830262seq_no_1157 a3050-11210-009-000D2aris_project_no7 a4355642aris_accn_no  aagid:7524779-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinan, MaudeeauthoruUSDA Southwest Climate Hub, Jornada Experimental Range, P.O.

Two process-based models, Forest-DNDC and Biome-BGC, with different spatial modeling scales were evaluated to estimate the potential effect of climate change on carbon sequestration in a tropical dry semi-deciduous forest in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The results from the simulations using the two models show that carbon sequestration in this dry forest is highly sensitive to warming. Carbon uptake in this forest may increase or decrease slightly with a corresponding increase or decrease in precipitation; however, with an increase in temperature, carbon uptake may decrease significantly, showing that warming may be the main climate factor that impacts carbon storage in this tropical dry forest. Model performance evaluation indicates that both models may be used to estimate C stocks, but DNDC may be better than BGC for assessing the effect of climate change on C dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adeforestation 3adry forests 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest management 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3atemperature 3atropical forests 3aMexico 0aSecondary forest 0aKarstic landscape 0aBiomass 0aSoil carbon pool 0aForest-DNDC 0aBiome-BGC1 aJohnson, K.D.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, 11 Campus Blvd, Suite 200, Newtown Square, PA 19073, USA1 aBirdsey, R.A.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, 11 Campus Blvd, Suite 200, Newtown Square, PA 19073, USA1 aHernandez-Stefanoni, J.L.eauthoruCentro de Investigación Científica de Yucatán A.C., Unidad de Recursos Naturales, Calle 43# 130.

Secondly, this indicator is integrated into two simultaneous equation models to capture the marginal impacts of changes in biodiversity on the value of ecosystem goods and services (EGS) due to climate change.Our estimation results confirm the role of biodiversity as a nature-based policy solution for climate change mitigation, shedding light on the policy actions that generate co-benefits by enhancing ecosystems' capacity to mitigate climate change impacts, while conserving biodiversity and sustaining the flows of EGS for human livelihoods. Especially, nature-based mitigation policies are more cost-effective and better at coping with the ethic and inequality issues associated with distributional impacts of the policy actions, compared to the pure technical solutions to improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions. However, the strength of biodiversity as a nature-based policy option for climate change mitigation depends on both the nature of the EGS and the geographical area under consideration.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3aeconometrics 3aecosystem services 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3aequations 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3amodels 0aNatural capital index 0aComposite biodiversity indicator 0aEuropean forest ecosystem services 0aSimultaneous equation modeling 0a3SLS 0aNature-based policy for climate change mitigation1 aNunes, Paulo A.L.D.eauthoruWAVES — Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services, Agriculture and Environmental Services Department, The World Bank, Washington, DC 20433, USA0 tEcological economics.g2014 Jan., v. 97 p.60-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1162940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:11629b0921-8009c97e60  fEcological economics  aBatch:1456  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6053779909ExL  a2019-04-05  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00072-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S0921800913003339.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aUSDA  aagid:5377990  a2019-04-05  a2019-04-0504866nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098024004200137035002800179040001800207100014300225245012900368300001600497506002800513506003600541506007600577506003100653520193000684592002802614593001802642596008302660506003702743650002202780650001402802650001102816650001202827650002002839650001302859650002102872650001502893651002402908651001902932651001802951653002402969653002602993653002403019653001803043653002703061700014003088700010003228700009503328773012003423787003303543787001803576787002203594856008603616903002403702912001203726914004203738914002503780916001503805917001103820918003603831935002203867949001503889953006003904954006103964955003504025961001304060974001704073983001504090984001504105991563706650742620221207083849.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057293702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.05.0552doi7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.05.0552chorus  aagid:5729370-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhiablame, LaurenteauthoruDepartment of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD 57007, USA10aAnnual baseflow variations as influenced by climate variability and agricultural land use change in the Missouri River Basin  ap. 188-202.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe Missouri River system has a large water storage capacity, where baseflow plays an important role. Understanding historical baseflow characteristics with respect to climate and land use impacts is essential for effective planning and management of water resources in the Missouri River Basin (MORB). This study evaluated statistical trends in baseflow and precipitation for 99 MORB minimally disturbed watersheds during 1950–2014. Elasticity of baseflow to climate variability and agricultural land use change were quantified for the 99 studied watersheds. Baseflow was derived from daily streamflow records with a recursive digital filter method. The results showed that baseflow varied between 38 and 80% (0 and 331mm/year) of total streamflow with an average of 60%, indicating that more than half of streamflow in the MORB is derived from baseflow. The trend analysis revealed that precipitation increased during the study period in 78 out of 99 watersheds, leading to 1–3.9% noticeable increase in baseflow for 68 of 99 watersheds. Although the changes in baseflow obtained in this study were a result of the combined effects of climate and land use change across the basin, upward trends in baseflow generally coincide with increased precipitation and agricultural land use trends in the basin. Agricultural land use increase mostly led to a 0–5.7% decrease in annual baseflow in the basin, except toward east of the basin where baseflow mostly increased with agricultural land use increase (0.1–2.0%). In general, a 1% increase in precipitation and a 1% increase in agricultural land use resulted in 1.5% increase and 0.2% decrease in baseflow, respectively, during the study period. These results are entirely dependent on the quality of data used; however, they provide useful insight into the relative influence of climate and land use change on baseflow conditions in the Great Plains region of the USA.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3abase flow 3abasins 3aclimate 3aland use change 3aplanning 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aGreat Plains region 3aMissouri River 3aUnited States 0aWatershed hydrology 0aGroundwater discharge 0aCultivated cropland 0aPrecipitation 0aElasticity coefficient1 aSheshukov, Aleksey Y.eauthoruDepartment of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA1 aRahmani, VahideauthoruKansas Biological Survey, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA1 aMoriasi, DanieleauthoruUSDA-ARS Grazinglands Research Laboratory, El Reno, OK 73036, USA0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017 Aug., v. 551 p.188-202dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4653940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.05.0553Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46539b0022-1694c551e188  fJournal of hydrology  aBatch:1787  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6057293709ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00010-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0022169417303748.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:5729370  a2019-03-18  a2022-09-0603620nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098024003600137035002800173040001800201100011600219245010400335300001400439506007600453506003100529520086500560592002801425593001801453596006001471596006201531506003701593650002301630650003001653650001901683650002401702650002101726650002201747650001301769650002001782650001501802650000901817650002001826700010001846700008401946700008702030773011202117787003302229787001802262787001902280856008302299856004502382912001202427914003702439914003802476916001502514917001102529918003602540935002202576949001502598953009302613954006102706955003502767961000902802962004702811962001702858974001702875983001502892984001502907991563953070742620221207113040.0200607e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068501852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cois.2020.02.0032chorus7 a10.1016/j.cois.2020.02.0032doi  aagid:6850185-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, YaneauthoruDepartment of Biology/Ecology & Evolution, University of Fribourg, 1700 Fribourg, Switzerland10aBiocontrol of invasive weeds under climate change: progress, challenges and management implications  ap. 72-78.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aClimate change is predicted to increase the frequency and impact of plant invasions, creating a need for new control strategies as part of mitigation planning. The complex interactions between invasive plants and biocontrol agents have created distinct policy and management challenges, including the effectiveness and risk assessment of biocontrol under different climate change scenarios. In this brief review, we synthesize recent studies describing the potential ecological and evolutionary outcomes for biocontrol agents/candidates for plant invaders under climate change. We also discuss potential methodologies that can be used as a framework for predicting ecological and evolutionary responses of plant-natural enemy interactions under climate change, and for refining our understanding of the efficacy and risk of using biocontrol on invasive plants.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNovartis Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008273  cRural Housing Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000091670 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aclimate change 3aecological invasion 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3aplanning 3aplants (botany) 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk assessment1 aDing, JianqingeauthoruSchool of Life Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan 475004, China1 aSiemann, EvaneauthoruBiosciences Department, Rice University, Houston, TX USA1 aKeller, Stephen ReauthoruDepartment of Plant Biology, University of Vermont, USA0 tCurrent opinion in insect science.g2020 Apr., v. 38 p.72-78dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23301x2214-57457nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2330140uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2020.02.0033Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/6850185  aArticle  aJournal:23301b2214-5745c38e72  fCurrent opinion in insect science  aBatch:2473  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6068501859ExL  a2020-06-08  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/141086810889928848-00002-HEAD-ONLY-REVISEDSUBJECTLIST.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S2214574520300250.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 2214-5753  aMissing ISSN  aagid:6850185  a2020-06-07  a2022-09-0604100nab a2200817 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100014500182245012000327300001400447520113200461592002801593593001801621650001601639650001801655650002201673650001101695650001701706650002101723650001101744650001901755650001901774650002101793650002001814650001301834650001601847650001201863650002201875650001201897650001401909650001301923650001101936650001001947651002101957651003101978651001102009653001802020653002302038653002602061653002902087653002402116653001502140653000902155700011402164700015202278700014502430773013002575787003302705787001802738787002102756856008502777912001202862914004002874914003402914916001502948917001102963918003602974935002203010949001503032953008003047954006103127955003503188961001203223974001703235983001503252984001503267991564004820742620221119125519.0190624e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063573022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.03.0112doi  aagid:6357302-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyka, Stephen A.eauthoruDepartment of Bioagricultural Sciences and Pest Management, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA10aResponse of eastern white pine and associated foliar, blister rust, canker and root rot pathogens to climate change  ap. 18-26.  aClimate model predictions for the northeastern U.S. forecast a warmer and wetter climate, which favors the survival, reproduction and dispersal of foliar diseases of eastern white pine, collectively called White Pine Needle Damage (WPND). Foliar diseases cause defoliation of white pine, leading to growth reductions, canopy dieback and predisposing trees to other pathogens and insects. This situation is very similar to other conifer foliar diseases, such as Dothistroma needle blight (DNB) in British Columbia and Swiss needle cast (SNC) in Oregon, where the climate is also becoming warmer and wetter. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent WPND findings of the impact climate change, particularly increased spring precipitation and annual warming has on the emergence of this disease complex. These findings will then be related to what is currently known about climatic factors affecting DNB and SNC and their role as native foliar pathogens affecting their natural forest ecosystems. We also discuss other eastern white pine diseases such as blister rust, cankers, and root rots in relation to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aDothistroma 3aPinus strobus 3aSwiss needle cast 3ablight 3ablister rust 3acankers (plants) 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3aconifer needles 3aconifers 3adefoliation 3adieback 3aforest ecosystems 3ainsects 3apathogens 3aroot rot 3aspring 3atrees 3aBritish Columbia 3aNortheastern United States 3aOregon 0aPinus strobus 0aCaliciopsis canker 0aDiplodia shoot blight 0aBrown spot needle blight 0aCronartium ribicola 0aArmallaria 0aWPND1 aMunck, Isabel A.eauthoruForest Health Protection, USDA Forest Service, 271 Mast Road, Durham, NH 03824, USA1 aBrazee, Nicholas J.eauthoruUMass Extension, Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01002, USA1 aBroders, Kirk D.eauthoruDepartment of Bioagricultural Sciences and Pest Management, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 423 p.18-26dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl901340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl9013b0378-1127c423e18  fForest ecology and management  aBatch:2189  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6063573029ExL  a2019-06-24  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/36528-00001-HEAD-ONLY-REVISEDSUBJECTLIST.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0378112717318303.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6357302  a2019-06-24  a2019-06-2404430nab a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098024003000125035002800155040001800183100014600201245011100347300001800458500002000476520204400496592002802540593001802568650002602586650001902612650002102631650001102652650001902663650001002682650001302692650001102705650001402716650000902730650001502739650001102754650002002765650001602785650001002801651001802811700013702829700002602966700002802992700014103020773012403161787003303285787001803318787002203336856007303358912001203431914004603443914002603489916001503515917001103530918004303541935002203584949001503606953002803621961001203649962004803661974001703709983001503726984001503741991564015560742620221119131848.0180102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058780052DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.133282doi7 a10.1111/gcb.133282chorus  aagid:5878005-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFord, Kevin R.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3625 93rd Ave SW, Olympia, WA, 98512, USA. kford10@gmail.com10aWill changes in phenology track climate change? A study of growth initiation timing in coast Douglas‐fir  ap. 3712-3723.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnder climate change, the reduction of frost risk, onset of warm temperatures and depletion of soil moisture are all likely to occur earlier in the year in many temperate regions. The resilience of tree species will depend on their ability to track these changes in climate with shifts in phenology that lead to earlier growth initiation in the spring. Exposure to warm temperatures (‘forcing’) typically triggers growth initiation, but many trees also require exposure to cool temperatures (‘chilling’) while dormant to readily initiate growth in the spring. If warming increases forcing and decreases chilling, climate change could maintain, advance or delay growth initiation phenology relative to the onset of favorable conditions. We modeled the timing of height‐ and diameter‐growth initiation in coast Douglas‐fir (an ecologically and economically vital tree in western North America) to determine whether changes in phenology are likely to track changes in climate using data from field‐based and controlled‐environment studies, which included conditions warmer than those currently experienced in the tree's range. For high latitude and elevation portions of the tree's range, our models predicted that warming will lead to earlier growth initiation and allow trees to track changes in the onset of the warm but still moist conditions that favor growth, generally without substantially greater exposure to frost. In contrast, toward lower latitude and elevation range limits, the models predicted that warming will lead to delayed growth initiation relative to changes in climate due to reduced chilling, with trees failing to capture favorable conditions in the earlier parts of the spring. This maladaptive response to climate change was more prevalent for diameter‐growth initiation than height‐growth initiation. The decoupling of growth initiation with the onset of favorable climatic conditions could reduce the resilience of coast Douglas‐fir to climate change at the warm edges of its distribution.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acoasts 3acold treatment 3afrost 3alatitude 3amodels 3aphenology 3arisk 3asoil water 3aspring 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3atrees 3aNorth America1 aHarrington, Constance A.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3625 93rd Ave SW, Olympia, WA, 98512, USA1 aBansal, Sheeleauthor1 aGould, Peter J.eauthor1 aSt. Clair, J.

First documented in the spring of 2010 affecting 24 328 hectares in the state of Maine, white pine needle damage (WPND) has continued to spread and is now well established in all New England states. While causal agents of WPND are known, current research is lacking in both sampling distribution and the specific environmental factor(s) that affect the development and spread of this disease complex. This study aims to construct a more detailed distribution map of the four primary causal agents within the region, as well as utilize long‐term WPND monitoring plots and data collected from land‐based weather stations to develop a climatic model to predict the severity of defoliation events in the proceeding year. Sampling results showed a greater distribution of WPND than previously reported. WPND was generally found in forest stands that compromised >50% eastern white pine by basal area. No single species, nor a specific combination of species had a dominating presence in particular states or regions, thus supporting the disease complex theory that WPND is neither caused by an individual species nor by a specific combination of species. In addition, regional weather data confirmed the trend of increasing temperature and precipitation observed in this region with the previous year's May, June, and July rainfall being the best predictor of defoliation events in the following year. Climatic models were developed to aid land managers in predicting disease severity and accordingly adjust their management decisions.

A vulnerability assessment is performed in the state of Georgia (United States) at the county level from 1975 to 2012 in decadal increments. Climate change vulnerability is typically measured as a function of exposure to physical phenomena (e.g., droughts, floods), sensitivity to factors affecting the social milieu, and the capacity of a given unit to adapt to changing physical conditions. The paper builds on previous assessments and offers a unique approach to vulnerability analyses by combining climatic, social, land cover, and hydrological components together into a unified vulnerability assessment, which captures both long-term and hydroclimatic events. Climate change vulnerability indices are derived for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. Climate change exposure is measured as: 1) departure of decadal mean temperature and precipitation from baseline temperature and precipitation (1971–2000) using the United States Historical Climatology Network version 2.5 and 2) extreme hydroclimatic hazards indicated by flood, heat wave and drought events. Sensitivity and adaptive capacity are measured by well-established conceptualizations and methods built derived from socioeconomic variables. Impervious surface and flood susceptibility area are also incorporated to account for place-based vulnerability.Anomalies in temperature and precipitation with an overall trend towards drying and warming have been observed. The anomalous cooling period in Georgia during the 1970–1980 period as well as the post-1980 warm-up have been captured with a clearly established increase in extreme hydroclimatic events in recent decades. Climate vulnerability is highest in some metropolitan Atlanta and coastal counties. However, the southwestern region of Georgia, and part of the rural Black belt region are found to be especially vulnerable to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimatology 3acooling 3adrought 3adrying 3afloods 3ageography 3aheat 3aland cover 3aphysical phenomena 3asocioeconomic factors 3atemperature 3aGeorgia 0aClimate change 0aBiophysical and social vulnerabilities 0aClimate extremes 0aGeorgia1 aShepherd, J.

Conservation planning has only recently begun to adequately account for dynamic threats such as climate change. We propose a method to incorporate climate-dynamic environmental domains, identified using specific environmental correlates of floristic composition, into conservation strategies, using the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa as a case study. The environmental domains offer an approach to conservation that conserves diversity under current and future climates, recognising that the species constituting diversity may change through time. We mapped current locations of domains by identifying their positions in a multi-dimensional environmental space using a non-hierarchical iterative k-means clustering algorithm. Their future locations were explored using an ensemble of future climate scenarios. The HadCM2 and GFDL2.1 models represented the extreme ranges of the models. The magnitude of change in each environmental domain was calculated using Euclidean distances to determine areas of greatest and least stability for each future climate projection. Domains occurring in the savanna biome increase at the expense of domains occurring in the grassland biome, which has significant negative consequences for the species rich grasslands. The magnitude of change maps represents areas of changed climatic conditions or edaphic disjunctions. The HadCM2 model predicted the greatest overall magnitude of change across the province. Species with specific soil requirements may not be able to track changing climatic conditions. A vulnerability framework was developed that incorporated climatic stability and habitat intactness indices. The mean magnitude of change informed the potential speed of transition of domains between the vulnerability quadrants. The framework informs appropriate conservation actions to mitigate climate change impacts on biodiversity. The study explicitly links floristic pattern and climate variability and provides useful insights to facilitate conservation planning for climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aalgorithms 3abotanical composition 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3ageography 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aphenology 3aplanning 3asavannas 3asoil 3aSouth Africa 0aClimatic stability 0aConservation planning 0aGradient analysis 0aHabitat intactness 0aRefugia 0aCCAM 0aCEC 0aIPCC 0aKZN 0aMAP 0aMAT1 aErasmus, Barend F.N.eauthoruSchool of Animal, Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Private Bag X3, WITS, 2050, South Africa1 aGoodman, Peter S.eauthoruEzemvelo KZN Wildlife, Biodiversity Division, Scientific Services, PO Box 13053, Cascades 3202, South Africa1 aO'Connor, Timothy G.eauthoruSchool of Animal, Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Private Bag X3, WITS, 2050, South Africa1 aHargrove, William W.eauthoruEastern Forest Environmental Threat Assessment Center, USDA Forest Service, 200 WT Weaver Blvd, Asheville, NC 28804-3454, USA1 aMaddalena, Damian M.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental Studies, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, NC, USA1 aWitkowski, Ed.

Accurate forecasting of switchgrass yield across a geographically diverse region and under future climate conditions is essential for determining a realistic future ethanol production from switchgrass. This study compiled a switchgrass database through reviewing the existing literature from field trials across U.S. Using observed switchgrass data, two models, an additive regression model (ARM) in machine learning and a process-based model (ALMANAC), were developed. Through ARM simulation, the relationships among few yield determinant parameters (e.g. climate, location, and management) and switchgrass yield were determined. According to results of ARM simulation, switchgrass yields were highly related to longitude of planting location. The ALMANAC simulation results, in contrast, showed that crop management had more effect on yield than planting location. Since the ALMANAC model consists of functional relationships that provide better understating of interactions among plant physiological processes and environmental factors (water, soil, climate, and nutrient) giving realistic predictions in different climate condition, it was used to quantify the impacts of climate change on switchgrass yields. Simulated lowland switchgrass would have more yield decreases in 2050 with low fertilizer input than high fertilizer input. Simulated upland yields are stable under high fertilizer input. This study result showed that N fertilization is a key factor in controlling switchgrass yields under future climate conditions.  aPubAg article  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000079170 fUnrestricted online access2star  eARIS manuscript 3aC4 plants 3aPanicum virgatum 3aartificial intelligence 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acrop management 3adatabases 3aedaphic factors 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3afuel production 3ahighlands 3aindigenous species 3alongitude 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aperennials 3aplanting 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asoil nutrients 3asoil water regimes 3awarm season 3ayields 3aUnited States1 aKim, Sojungeauthor1 aCho, Jaepileauthor1 aPark, Seonggyueauthor1 aPerez, Fernandoeauthor1 aKiniry, James R.eauthor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7175-78070 tAgronomy.g2020 Apr., v. 10, no. 4 p.503-521wJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1236140uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/69346003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100405033Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:12361b2073-4395c10d4e503  fAgronomy  aBatch:2532  aissued  aIND6069346009ExL  a2020-07-13  bUSDA  aARIS Manuscript  aARIS manuscript submission  aBatch:2532 reviewed on 2020-07-13T16:00:02Z  aagid:6934600  a2020-05-07  a2021-07-0704701nab a2201069 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002500097024002100122035002600143040001800169072000900187072000900196072000900205072000900214072000900223072000900232100002200241245010300263300001600366500002400382500002300406500001500429520147100444593001801915593002001933650002701953650002101980650002502001650002202026650002102048650001902069650002602088650001402114650002202128650001902150650003302169650002502202650002602227650000902253650002202262650003202284650002102316650001502337650001702352650001302369650002102382650001902403651002302422651001102445651001302456651001102469653002302480653002302503653001902526653001902545700002302564700002402587700002702611700002502638700002302663700002302686700001802709700002002727700002202747700002302769700002302792773009702815787001802912787003302930787003002963787002102993852000903014856007503023856011203098912001203210914004303222914004203265917001103307930003303318935002103351945002503372946001103397949001503408952005103423961001203474974001503486984001503501985010303516986001203619991564683730742620221119123004.0090305e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441719542DNAL7 a10.1139/X08-1042doi7 a10113/265312hdl  aagid:26531-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aK001 0aX100 0aJ100 0aF400 0aW0001 aCampbell, John L.10aConsequences of climate change for biogeochemical cycling in forests of northeastern North America  ap. 264-284.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aA critical component of assessing the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems involves understanding associated changes in the biogeochemical cycling of elements. Evidence from research on northeastern North American forests shows that direct effects of climate change will evoke changes in biogeochemical cycling by altering plant physiology, forest productivity, and soil physical, chemical, and biological processes. Indirect effects, largely mediated by changes in species composition, length of growing season, and hydrology, will also be important. The case study presented here uses the quantitative biogeochemical model PnET-BGC to test assumptions about the direct and indirect effects of climate change on a northern hardwood forest ecosystem. Modeling results indicate an overall increase in net primary production due to a longer growing season, an increase in NO3- leaching due to large increases in net mineralization and nitrification, and slight declines in mineral weathering due to a reduction in soil moisture. Future research should focus on uncertainties, including the effects of (1) multiple simultaneous interactions of stressors (e.g., climate change, ozone, acidic deposition); (2) long-term atmospheric CO2 enrichment on vegetation; (3) changes in forest species composition; (4) extreme climatic events and other disturbances (e.g., ice storms, fire, invasive species); and (5) feedback mechanisms that increase or decrease change.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aatmospheric deposition 3agreenhouse gases 3aprimary productivity 3amycorrhizal fungi 3avegetation cover 3aglobal warming 3abiogeochemical cycles 3ahydrology 3aforest ecosystems 3aclimate models 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3avegetation structure 3aquantitative analysis 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3abiological activity in soil 3aclimatic factors 3aprediction 3aroot systems 3anitrogen 3ahardwood forests 3agrowing season 3aNew England region 3aQuebec 3aNew York 0aCanada 0aliterature reviews 0aAtlantic provinces 0aPnET-BGC model 0aclimate change1 aRustad, Lindsey E.1 aBoyer, Elizabeth W.1 aChristopher, Sheila F.1 aDriscoll, Charles T.1 aFernandez, Ivan J.1 aGroffman, Peter M.1 aHoule, Daniel1 aKiekbusch, Jana1 aMagill, Alison H.1 aMitchell, Myron J.1 aOllinger, Scott V.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2009 Feb., v.  39, no.  2 p.264-284x0045-50677nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl2003  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X08-1043Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/265313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl2003b0045-5067c39d2e264  fCanadian journal of forest research =  aissued  a20090312b20090508c00000000  aIND441719549ExL  aINDdLYNe2009/03/12  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20090312 20090508 00000000bIND LYN 2009/03/12  aUSDA/FS  aagid:26531  a2012-06-07  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a417195405250nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100012000179245015500299300001600454520232800470592002802798593001802826650001702844650001102861650001102872650001702883650001202900650001902912650002402931650001202955650001502967650002202982650001703004650001003021650002503031650002103056650001003077650001403087650002703101650000903128650002203137650002503159650001003184650001603194650001403210651002603224700010003250700012803350700009403478700010503572700010803677773009903785787003303884787001803917787002203935856008103957912001204038914004404050914001504094916001504109917001104124918002904135935002204164949001504186953006704201954005604268955003704324961001204361962004804373974001704421983001504438984001504453991565123600742620221119151146.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059650662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-017-0175-32doi  aagid:5965066-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheller, RobertM.eauthoruPortland State University, P.O.

In particular, bark beetles are important disturbance agents although their long-term interactions with future climate change are poorly understood. Droughts and the associated moisture deficit contribute to the onset of bark beetle outbreaks although outbreak extent and severity is dependent upon the density of host trees, wildfire, and forest management. Our objective was to estimate the effects of climate change and bark beetle outbreaks on ecosystem carbon dynamics over the next century in a western US forest. Specifically, we hypothesized that (a) bark beetle outbreaks under climate change would reduce net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) and increase uncertainty and (b) these effects could be ameliorated by fuels management. We also examined the specific tree species dynamics—competition and release—that determined NECB response to bark beetle outbreaks. Our study area was the Lake Tahoe Basin (LTB), CA and NV, USA, an area of diverse forest types encompassing steep elevation and climatic gradients and representative of mixed-conifer forests throughout the western United States. We simulated climate change, bark beetles, wildfire, and fuels management using a landscape-scale stochastic model of disturbance and succession. We simulated the period 2010–2100 using downscaled climate projections. Recurring droughts generated conditions conducive to large-scale outbreaks; the resulting large and sustained outbreaks significantly increased the probability of LTB forests becoming C sources over decadal time scales, with slower-than-anticipated landscape-scale recovery. Tree species composition was substantially altered with a reduction in functional redundancy and productivity. Results indicate heightened uncertainty due to the synergistic influences of climate change and interacting disturbances. Our results further indicate that current fuel management practices will not be effective at reducing landscape-scale outbreak mortality. Our results provide critical insights into the interaction of drivers (bark beetles, wildfire, fuel management) that increase the risk of C loss and shifting community composition if bark beetle outbreaks become more frequent.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abark beetles 3abasins 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aforest management 3aforest types 3afuels 3afuels (fire ecology) 3ainsect outbreaks 3alakes 3amortality 3anet ecosystem exchange 3arisk 3aspecies diversity 3astochastic processes 3atrees 3auncertainty 3awildfires 3aWestern United States1 aKretchun, AlecM.eauthoruPortland State University, P.O.

Furthermore, most climate change adaptation efforts emphasize where to implement management actions, whereas timing remains largely overlooked. The rate of modern climate change introduces urgency in evaluating whether delaying conservation actions compromises their efficacy for reaching important conservation targets. We evaluated the importance of multiple climate change adaptation strategies including timing of actions on preventing extinctions for a threatened climate‐sensitive species, the Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus). We parameterized a range‐wide population viability analysis model that related demographic sensitivities to drought events and human‐modified land cover to assess vulnerability to future climate change. Using simulations, we assessed the efficacy and trade‐offs associated with alternative climate adaptation strategies aimed at maximizing the number of future populations including when to initiate conservation actions, duration of management, number of managed populations, and local management effectiveness. Population‐level projections under future climate change scenarios revealed a broad‐scale pattern of range contraction in the southwestern portion of the current range. Along the extinction gradient, we identified demographic strongholds and refugia critical for population persistence under climate change as well as populations at high risk of extinction and candidates for climate change adaptation actions. In the context of future climate change, the timing of conservation actions was crucial; acting earlier maximized chances of achieving conservation targets. Even considering uncertainty in climate change projections, delaying actions was less efficient and introduced undesirable trade‐offs including the need to implement conservation actions for longer or targeting more populations to achieve a similar conservation target. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight how acting quickly reduces risk and improves outcomes for a highly vulnerable species under future climate change. Climate change vulnerability assessments require translation of model‐based outputs into tractable information for climate change adaptation planning. Quantifying trade‐offs associated with the multidimensional decision space related to species conservation and recovery planning is a critical step in climate change adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUpper Midwest and Great Lakes Landscape Conservation Cooperative  cDepartment of Forest and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin‐Madison 3aSistrurus catenatus 3aat-risk population 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aextinction 3aland cover 3amodels 3aplanning 3apopulation viability analysis 3arefuge habitats 3arisk 3auncertainty 3avulnerable species1 aPomara, Lars Y.eauthoruDepartment of Forest and Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin‐Madison, Madison, Wisconsin1 aZuckerberg, BenjamineauthoruDepartment of Forest and Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin‐Madison, Madison, Wisconsin0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2018 Nov., v. 55, no. 6 p.2843-2853dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5729840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.132413Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57298b0021-8901c55d6e2843  fJournal of applied ecology  aBatch:2099  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6061622189ExL  a2018-11-29  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/00218901_2018_55_6.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/00218901_2018_55_6.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2099 reviewed on 2018-11-29T16:00:02Z  aagid:6162218  a2018-10-15  a2018-11-2904450nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004200098024003900140035002800179040001800207100011200225245014900337506010400486506007600590506003100666520186500697592002802562593001802590596007202608596006002680596004502740506003702785650001102822650001902833650001202852650000902864650001102873650002302884650000902907650001902916650001602935650002102951653001002972653001202982653000902994653001503003653001303018653001803031653001003049773010103059787003303160787001803193787001803211856008603229912001203315914004103327914002603368916001603394917001103410918003603421935002203457949001503479953009103494954006103585955003503646961001203681974001703693983001503710984001503725991565205750742620221215142836.0220606e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076166642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1085122chorus7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1085122doi  aagid:7616664-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanberry, Brice B.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Rapid City, SD 57702, USA10aGlobal population densities, climate change, and the maximum monthly temperature threshold as a potential tipping point for high urban densities  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aHeat waves lasting days or weeks are among potential hazards expected to increase with climate change, but beyond heat waves, sustained temperatures may be incompatible with high urban population densities. I examined patterns of population density classes and exposure to maximum monthly temperature to identify where high urban population density classes were more at risk for prolonged heat than other density classes and if heat may have influenced high urban population densities during the recent past (1970–2000). Then, I considered exposure of population density classes to maximum monthly temperature during the near future (2021–2040, under the sustainability shared socio-economic pathway ssp1-2.6) and the long-range future (2081–2100, under fossil fuel-driven ssp5-8.5) for three general circulation models. Population densities generally increased with increasing maximum monthly temperature by country; the highest density urban class had the greatest exposure to heat for 82 out of 199 countries. By temperature zone, the hypertropical zone inverted the order such that population densities increased with decreasing maximum monthly temperature, indicating that concentrated populations generally did not develop at high maximum monthly temperatures ≥ 36 °C. The 36 °C maximum monthly temperature threshold corresponds to heat wave warnings, which typically consist of a few consecutive days. Therefore, 36 °C maximum monthly temperature may indicate the start of an inhospitable tipping point beyond which human civilization may not flourish. Most land area will exceed 36 °C maximum monthly temperature under the CanESM5 ssp5-8.5 scenario by 2081–2100. Adaptation is not sufficient to moderate sustained unrelenting heat and migration of human populations would be less feasible than mitigation to reduce carbon emissions.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cRocky Mountain Research Stationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100014586  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006959  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3afossils 3aheat 3ahumans 3apopulation density 3arisk 3asocioeconomics 3atemperature 3aurban population 0aCMIP6 0aExurban 0aHeat 0aMitigation 0aSuburban 0aTipping point 0aUrban0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Feb., v. 135 p.108512-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)619640uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1085123Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:6196b1470-160Xc135e108512  fEcological indicators  aBatch:10220  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6076166649ExL  a2022-02-23  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/152621049099972364-00006-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S1470160X21011778.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7616664  a2022-06-06  a2022-09-0604818nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002300115024003600138024001200174035002800186040001800214100013200232245003300364300001800397500002000415500000900435506017300444520202200617592002802639593001802667593002002685650001302705650000802718650001902726650001202745650001902757650001602776650002202792650001502814650002202829650001302851650001502864650001602879650001902895650001502914650001102929650001102940650001702951650002002968650001602988650002503004773013503029787003303164787001803197787002203215856011403237856008303351912001203434914004603446914002103492917001103513918004303524935002203567949001503589952001903604953005803623954006203681955003403743956014503777961001303922962003003935974001703965983001503982984001503997986001204012991565313750742620221214223503.0220803e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066326112DNAL7 a3354112aris7 a10113/66326112hdl7 a10.2134/agronj2016.10.06262doi8 ans16837  aagid:6632611-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatfield, JerryeauthoruUSDA‐ARS, National Lab for Agriculture and the Environment, 1015 N.

Increasing temperatures will cause a shift in turfgrass species to more northen climates. Variation among varieties of turfgrass provide opportunity to increase climate resilience. Climate change will increase abiotic and biotic stresses on turfgrass. Climate change is occurring and is impacting biological systems through increased temperatures, more variable precipitation, and increased CO₂ in the atmosphere. These effects have been documented for agricultural species, primarily grain crops, pasture and rangeland species. The extension of these relationships to turfgrass has been limited; however, these plants are an important part of our ecosystems and preservation of these plantings adds to social value and ecosystem services. Turfgrasses can be divided into cool‐season and warm‐season species and the projected changes in maximum air temperatures, along with increased root zone temperatures may promote a Northward migration of warm‐season turfgrasses. Increased spring precipitation and more variable summer precipitation coupled with more intense precipitation events are projected to occur requiring enhanced management of soil water. Turfgrass management to ensure adequate root zone soil water, and the selection of varieties or species with greater drought tolerance in the warmer regions will be necessary to preserve turfgrass plantings. Increases in CO₂ benefits turfgrass growth and positively affects water use efficiency, which decreases the potential effects of a more variable precipitation regime because of impacts on soil water use. Genotypic variation in response to soil water deficits provides a foundation for screening turfgrass species to adapt to climatic stresses. Changes in temperature and precipitation variation will increase the potential for abiotic and biotic stresses on turfgrasses. Turfgrass management will require increased attention to increased abiotic and biotic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aagronomy 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acold season 3adrought tolerance 3aecosystems 3agenetic variation 3apastures 3arangelands 3arhizosphere 3asocial benefit 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3aturf grasses 3aturf management 3awarm season 3awater use efficiency0 tAgronomy journal.g2017 July, v. 109, no. 4 p.1708-1718dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4459240uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/66326113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2016.10.06263Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44592b0002-1962c109d4e1708  fAgronomy journal  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6066326119ExL  a2022-08-04  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/00021962_2017_109_4.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/00021962_2017_109_4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/nal%2035411%20Hatfield%20turfgrass%20and%20climate%20change%202017.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aagid:6632611  a2022-08-03  a2022-08-04  ans1683704084nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003900097024002100136035002600157040001800183072000900201072000900210100001900219245009600238300001400334500002400348500001500372520183900387593001802226593002002244650002002264650002402284650001902308650001602327650002402343650001402367650002502381650002802406651000902434651001302443651001302456653001802469653001702487653001802504653001202522700002402534773009502558787001802653787003302671787003002704787002202734852000902756856011202765856008902877912001202966914004602978914002503024917001103049930003303060935002103093945002503114946001103139949001503150952005103165961001303216974001503229984001503244985010303259986001203362991565454580742620221119121238.0090918e20090930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442604082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.07.0292doi7 a10113/338752hdl  aagid:33875-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aB2001 aTomer, Mark D.12aA simple approach to distinguish land-use and climate-change effects on watershed hydrology  ap. 24-33.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aImpacts of climate change on watershed hydrology are subtle compared to cycles of drought and surplus precipitation (PPT), and difficult to separate from effects of land-use change. In the US Midwest, increasing baseflow has been more attributed to increased annual cropping than climate change. The agricultural changes have led to increased fertilizer use and nutrient losses, contributing to Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. In a 25-yr, small-watershed experiment in Iowa, when annual hydrologic budgets were accrued between droughts, a coupled water-energy budget (ecohydrologic) analysis showed effects of tillage and climate on hydrology could be distinguished. The fraction of PPT discharged increased with conservation tillage and time. However, unsatisfied evaporative demand (PET - Hargreaves method) increased under conservation tillage, but decreased with time. A conceptual model was developed and a similar analysis conducted on long-term (>1920s) records from four large, agricultural Midwest watersheds underlain by fine-grained tills. At least three of four watersheds showed decreases in PET, and increases in PPT, discharge, baseflow and PPT:PET ratios (p <0.10). An analysis of covariance showed the fraction of precipitation discharged increased, while unsatisfied evaporative demand decreased with time among the four watersheds (p <0.001). Within watersheds, agricultural changes were associated with ecohydrologic shifts that affected timing and significance, but not direction, of these trends. Thus, an ecohydrologic concept derived from small-watershed research, when regionally applied, suggests climate change has increased discharge from Midwest watersheds, especially since the 1970s. By inference, climate change has increased susceptibility of nutrients to water transport, exacerbating Gulf of Mexico hypoxia.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aland use change 3aagricultural runoff 3aclimate change 3aevaporation 3awatershed hydrology 3abase flow 3aconservation tillage 3aagricultural watersheds 3aIowa 3aIllinois 3aMissouri 0awater balance 0aecohydrology 0aprecipitation 0atillage1 aSchilling, Keith E.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Sept. 30, v.  376, no.  1-2 p.24-33dElsevierx0022-16947nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl46539  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/338753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.07.0293Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46539b0022-1694c376d1-2e24  fJournal of hydrology  aissued  a20090929b20091106c00000000  aIND442604089ExL  aINDdRHFe2009/09/28  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20090929 20091106 00000000bIND RHF 2009/09/28  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:33875  a2009-11-07  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a426040804439nab a2200841 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002100115024003600136024001200172035002600184040001800210100003000228245010400258300001800362500000900380506017300389520137600562592002801938593001801966594002201984595005402006593002002060650002202080650001502102650001902117650002402136650001802160650001002178650002002188650002802208650001102236650002202247650001602269650001102285650002602296650001302322650001802335650001902353650001602372650001702388651001302405651002402418700002802442700002802470773013502498787003302633787001802666787002202684856011202706856008302818912001202901914004602913914002102959916001502980917001102995918002703006935002203033949001503055953005203070954005603122955004503178956023003223961000903453962003003462962004803492974001503540983001503555984001503570986001203585991565783230742620221214225324.0191122e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000632632DNAL7 a3309542aris7 a10113/632632hdl7 a10.2134/agronj2016.07.04062doi8 ans11490  aagid:63263-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, David C.eauthor10aEvaluating Potential Dryland Cropping Systems Adapted to Climate Change in the Central Great Plains  ap. 2391-2405.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aClimate in the semiarid central Great Plains is expected to become warmer and drier in coming decades, with potentially greater variability in precipitation and temperature. Cropping systems that include forages and allow flexibility for determining if a crop should be planted and which crop to plant (based on available soil water at planting) may provide the opportunity to maintain economic viability in a changing climate environment. The objective of this study was to compare cropping system productivity and profitability of flexible rotations that incorporate forages against grain-based cropping systems that are set rotational sequences. Yield and net returns for five set rotations and three flexible rotations were compared at Akron, CO, over 5 yr. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields were reduced by 57% when the fallow period prior to wheat production was replaced with crop production. Average net income was greatest for the continuously cropped all-forage set 3-yr rotation followed by the flexible 3-yr rotations that included wheat and forage phases. The lowest net returns were seen for the set grain-based rotations and the flexible wheat–grain crop rotation. Incorporating forage production as a phase in dryland wheat rotational systems can add profitability and sustainability to the production system in the face of climate variability.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article  a1044brdonahuec2017-02-03dcmartineze2017-02-03  eARIS manuscript 3aTriticum aestivum 3aarid lands 3aclimate change 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3adryland farming 3aeconomic sustainability 3aforage 3aforage production 3agrain yield 3aincome 3aplant available water 3aplanting 3aprofitability 3asemiarid zones 3atemperature 3awinter wheat 3aColorado 3aGreat Plains region1 aVigil, Merle F.eauthor1 aHansen, Neil C.eauthor0 tAgronomy journal.g2016 Nov., v. 108, no. 6 p.2391-2405dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4459240uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/632633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2016.07.04063Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44592b0002-1962c108d6e2391  fAgronomy journal  aBatch:1543  aissued2 aACSESSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6000632639ExL  a2019-09-09  a/data/metadata/incoming/acsess_backfiles/aj.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/acsess_backfiles/aj.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/acsess_backfiles/  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/633%202016%20Nielsen%20-%20Evaluating%20potential%20dryland%20cropping%20systems%20adapted%20to%20climate%20change%20in%20the%20central%20Great%20Plains.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:1543 reviewed on 2017-02-14T12:00:02Z  aagid:63263  a2019-11-22  a2019-11-22  ans1149005644nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100020200171245015900373300001800532500001900550500002000569520206500589592002802654593001802682596005202700596005402752596010402806596007702910650001102987650001302998650001203011650001903023650003003042650002503072650002503097650001103122650001103133650001703144650001703161651002003178700022203198700016903420700024703589700024903836700019104085773012204276787003304398787001804431787002204449856007304471912001204544914004504556914002604601916001604627917001104643918004304654935002204697949001504719953005704734954006104791955003404852961001304886974001704899983001504916984001504931991565866150742620221119185215.0210410e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073366722DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.155592doi  aagid:7336672-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez‐López, OscareauthoruDepartamento Agricultura, Sociedad y Ambiente, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, San Cristóbal de Las Casas, Chiapas, México1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3996-092810aReduction in the potential distribution of bumble bees (Apidae: Bombus) in Mesoamerica under different climate change scenarios: Conservation implications  ap. 1772-1787.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBumble bees are an ecologically and economically important group of pollinating insects worldwide. Global climate change is predicted to affect bumble bee ecology including habitat suitability and geographic distribution. Our study aims to estimate the impact of projected climate change on 18 Mesoamerican bumble bee species. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) using current and future climate emissions scenarios (representative concentration pathway 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and models (CCSM4, HadGEM2‐AO, and MIROC‐ESM‐CHEM). Regardless of the scenario and model applied, our results suggest that all bumble bee species are predicted to undergo a reduction in their potential distribution and habitat suitability due to projected climate change. ENMs based on low emission scenarios predict a distribution loss ranging from 7% to 67% depending on the species for the year 2050. Furthermore, we discovered that the reduction of bumble bee geographic range shape will be more evident at the margins of their distribution. The reduction of suitable habitat is predicted to be accompanied by a 100–500 m upslope change in altitude and 1–581 km shift away from the current geographic centroid of a species' distribution. On average, protected natural areas in Mesoamerica cover ~14% of each species' current potential distribution, and this proportion is predicted to increase to ~23% in the high emission climate change scenarios. Our models predict that climate change will reduce Mesoamerican bumble bee habitat suitability, especially for rare species, by reducing their potential distribution ranges and suitability. The small proportion of current and future potential distribution falling in protected natural areas suggests that such areas will likely have marginal contribution to bumble bee habitat conservation. Our results have the capacity to inform stakeholders in designing effective landscape management for bumble bees, which may include developing restoration plans for montane pine oak forests habitats and native flowering plants.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cDavid H.

The random forests classification tree procedures produced an 8-variable algorithm that had an 8% overall error rate. Erroneous predictions of presence, or errors of commission, were 13%, while falsely predicting absence, or errors of omission were 1%. Climate-based multiple regression models were developed to describe patterns of genetic variation among 112 populations representing the range of P. strobus in Ontario, Canada east of Lake Superior. Degree days >5°C was the best predictor of variation in phenology and growth potential, with 5-year height providing the greatest resolution of inter-population variation (R2=0.68). Cold hardiness in the fall was most closely associated with mean minimum temperature (R2=0.26). Height growth data from four disparate provenance test series that together included a total of 354 provenances corroborated the range-wide applicability of the regional genetic models. Although variation in growth potential in the central Appalachian Mountains was most closely associated with mean minimum temperature, degree days >5°C remained the best predictor of range-wide variation in growth potential (R2=0.41). The contemporary distribution and inter-population genetic variation were projected into future climates predicted by three General Circulation Models, two scenarios, and three time steps. All projections indicate early and sustained deterioration in the contemporary habitat. Concurrence among projections regarding the redistribution of suitable habitat to the north of the contemporary distribution identifies geographic locations with the highest probability of supporting vigorous stands of P. strobus.

In order to monitor vegetation dynamic and changes, high spatial resolution satellite imagery with frequent acquisition is required. However, current satellite systems cannot satisfy these requirements due to either technical or fiscal difficulties. In recent years, studies have been focused on integrating high spatial resolution Landsat and high temporal resolution MODIS data for vegetation monitoring. This chapter describes three categories of approach to integrate two data sources. The first category approach adopts MODIS algorithms for Landsat data processing. The second category approach blends Landsat and MODIS data through a data fusion approach. The third category approach normalizes Landsat data using standard MODIS data products. This chapter presents examples and recent applications on the integration of Landsat and MODIS data. Their advantages and limitations are discussed.  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3avegetation0 tSatellite-based Applications on Climate Change.g2013,  p.247-261dSpringer Netherlandsz978-94-007-5871-17nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/11759393Available in the National Agricultural Library Digital Collections40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-5872-8_163Available from publisher's site  aArticle  fSatellite-based Applications on Climate Change  aBatch:755  aissued  aIND6011759399ExL  a2017-03-07  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/303152_1_En_16.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:755 annotated on 2014-12-11T20:14:16Z  aBatch:755 reviewed on 2015-01-13T16:00:04Z  aBatch:755 reviewed on 2015-01-15T11:00:02Z  aagid:1175939  eAccept - AGRICOLA  a2014-11-26  a2021-10-12  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans591505702nab a2200889 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098035002800137040001800165100013700183245012700320300001400447520193900461592002802400593001802428650001302446650001102459650001202470650001902482650001502501650001802516650001002534650002102544650001802565650001902583650001302602650002102615650001902636650000902655650001302664650001502677650001802692650001802710650002102728650001502749650001102764650001102775651001802786653001102804653001302815653001602828653001902844653000902863653001002872700013802882700014503020700011603165700011603281700014503397700010603542700010703648700017403755700011503929700011604044773010704160787003304267787001804300787002004318856008604338912001204424914003004436914003204466916001504498917001104513918003604524935002204560949001504582953006004597954006104657955003504718961001204753974001704765983001504782984001504797991566332990742620221119164046.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056026122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.12.0282doi  aagid:5602612-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurán, JorgeeauthoruCentre for Functional Ecology, Department of Life Sciences, University of Coimbra, 3000-456 Coimbra, Portugal10aDifferential sensitivity to climate change of C and N cycling processes across soil horizons in a northern hardwood forest  ap. 77-84.  aClimate of the northern hardwood forests of North America will become significantly warmer in the coming decades. Associated increases in soil temperature, decreases in water availability and changes in winter snow pack and soil frost are likely to affect soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Most studies of the effects of climate change on soil function have focused on the upper-organic part of the soil profile (e.g., forest floor), and little is known about effects on deeper mineral soil horizons. We exploited an elevation/orientation gradient at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (New Hampshire, USA) to evaluate how variation in climate, similar to that projected to occur over the next 50–100 years, affects soil C and N pools and transformation rates in different soil horizons of northern hardwood forests. Lower elevation, south-facing plots with higher soil temperature, less soil moisture and snow, and increased frequency of soil freeze/thaw events had less soil inorganic N content and lower potential net N mineralization rates compared to higher elevation, north facing plots. These differences in N pools and fluxes were consistent for all soil horizons, but sensitivity to climate variation increased with soil depth, confirming that assessments of climate change effects that do not consider variation throughout the soil profile are likely to be incomplete and potentially inaccurate. Nitrogen cycling processes were more sensitive to climate variation than C cycling processes, suggesting a decoupling of C and N cycles in coming decades, with important implications for ecosystem function. Soil processes showed greater sensitivity to climate variation in summer than in spring, and in the warmer and less snowy year of sampling, suggesting that the effects of climate change might become more pronounced as temperatures increase and snow fall and water availability decrease in the coming decades.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aaltitude 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aforest litter 3afrost 3ahardwood forests 3amineral soils 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen cycle 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asoil depth 3asoil horizons 3asoil profiles 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3aNew Hampshire 0aCarbon 0aNitrogen 0aForest soil 0aGlobal warming 0aSnow 0aFrost1 aMorse, Jennifer L.eauthoruPortland State University, Environmental Science and Management, PO Box 751 (ESM) Portland, OR 97207, USA1 aRodríguez, AlexandraeauthoruCentre for Functional Ecology, Department of Life Sciences, University of Coimbra, 3000-456 Coimbra, Portugal1 aCampbell, John L.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, 271 Mast Road, Durham, NH 03824, USA1 aChristenson, Lynn M.eauthoruVassar College, Biology Department, 124 Raymond Ave., Poughkeepsie, NY 12604, USA1 aDriscoll, Charles T.eauthoruSyracuse University, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 151 Link Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244, USA1 aFahey, Timothy J.eauthoruCornell University, Department of Natural Resources, Ithaca, NY 14850, USA1 aFisk, Melany C.eauthoruMiami University, Department of Zoology, 501 E High St, Oxford, OH 45056, USA1 aMitchell, Myron J.eauthoruSUNY-College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Department of Environmental Resources Engineering, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA1 aTempler, Pamela H.eauthoruBoston University, Department of Biology, 5 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215, USA1 aGroffman, Peter M.eauthoruCary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, 2801 Sharon Turnpike, Millbrook, NY 12545, USA0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2017 Apr., v. 107 p.77-84dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl12440uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl124b0038-0717  fSoil biology & biochemistry  aBatch:1551  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6056026129ExL  a2019-03-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00017-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0038071716308410.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:5602612  a2019-03-18  a2019-03-1804807nab a2200769 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003700098035002800135040001800163100014600181245013100327300001600458520197200474592002802446593001802474650002402492650001202516650001902528650001202547650002302559650001102582650001502593650002102608650002402629650001102653650000902664650000902673650001102682650001902693650002802712650001902740650002102759650002002780650002102800650002002821651001602841653002402857653002802881653001902909653002902928653002502957653003202982700017603014700014603190773011303336787003303449787001803482787002103500856008403521912001203605914004103617914003403658916001503692917001103707918003603718935002203754949001503776953007003791954007103861955004503932961001303977974001703990983001504007984001504022991566538510742620221119175226.0190403e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053544902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.01.0122doi  aagid:5354490-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, Won-HoeauthoruNational Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC), School of Natural Resources, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA10aIrrigation vulnerability assessment on agricultural water supply risk for adaptive management of climate change in South Korea  ap. 173-187.  aClimate change influences various environmental aspects, including those specifically related to agricultural water resources such as runoff, evapotranspiration, droughts and floods. Understanding the impact of climate change on reservoirs in relation to the passage of time is an important component of water resource management and the maintenance of a stable water supply. In different regions, changes in rainfall and hydrologic patterns due to climate change can increase the occurrences of reservoir water shortages and affect the future availability of agricultural water resources differently. It is a main concern for sustainable development in agricultural water resources management to evaluate the adaptive capability of a water supply under future climate conditions. Studies on climate change impacts and vulnerability assessments have been an essential process for preparing adaptive measures. This paper proposes a practical method to assess water supply vulnerability and sustainability in terms of climate change for the adaptive capability of agricultural reservoirs in South Korea based on a concept of probability theory and reliability analysis using time-dependent change analysis of water supply and demand. The objectives of this study were to investigate if there is evidence of climate change occurrences with respect to potential water supply capacity and irrigation water requirements; and to apply an irrigation vulnerability assessment model to assess the potential effects and predict the impacts of agricultural water demand and supply on reservoir operation to govern local water management decisions under climate variability and change. The irrigation vulnerability was estimated to evaluate the performance of water supplies in agricultural reservoirs; it is a recommended preparatory adaptive measure for developing a future water supply strategy in terms of using climate change scenarios reflecting different future conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aadaptive management 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3afloods 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3arain 3arisk 3arunoff 3asupply balance 3asustainable development 3awater analysis 3awater management 3awater potential 3awater reservoirs 3awater shortages 3aSouth Korea 0aAdaptive management 0aAgricultural reservoirs 0aClimate change 0aIrrigation vulnerability 0aReliability analysis 0aWater supply sustainability1 aChoi, Jin-YongeauthoruDepartment of Rural Systems Engineering and Research Institute for Agriculture & Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea1 aHong, Eun-MieauthoruUSDA-ARS Environmental Microbial & Food Safety Laboratory, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, MD, USA0 tAgricultural water management.g2015 Apr., v. 152 p.173-187dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774c152e173  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:1446  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6053544909ExL  a2019-04-03  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00066-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S0378377415000219.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:5354490  a2019-04-03  a2019-04-0304156nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098035002800139040001800167100014600185245011600331500001900447520122700466592002801693593001801721650002501739650002501764650003001789650001901819650001801838650001501856650001101871650002001882650001301902650003001915651002201945653001901967653002501986653004302011653001202054653001102066653001002077653001102087700012902098700015102227700012702378700010102505700015802606773010902764787003302873787001802906787001802924856008802942912001203030914003603042914003403078916001603112917001103128918003603139935002203175949001503197953009103212954006103303955003503364961001203399974001703411983001503428984001503443991566647930742620221119182825.0201025e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070134462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.1050742doi  aagid:7013446-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDes, M.eauthoruEnvironmental Physics Laboratory (EphysLab), CIM-UVIGO, Universidade de Vigo, Edificio Campus da Auga, 32004, Ourense, Spain14aThe impact of climate change on the geographical distribution of habitat-forming macroalgae in the Rías Baixas  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the current scenario of climate change characterized by a generalized warming, many species are facing local extinctions in areas with conditions near their thermal tolerance threshold. At present, the southern limit of the geographical distribution of several habitat-forming algae of cold-temperate affinities is located in the Northwest Iberian Peninsula, and the Rías Baixas may be acting as contemporary refugia at the range edge. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze future changes induced by ocean warming in this area that may induce changes in macroalgae populations. The Delft3D-Flow model forced with climatic data was used to calculate July–August sea surface temperature (SST) for the present (1999–2018) and for the far future (2080–2099). Mean daily SST was used to develop and calibrate a mechanistic geographical distribution model based on the thermal survival threshold of two intertidal habitat-forming macroalgae, namely Himanthalia elongata (L.) S.F.Gray and Bifurcaria bifurcata R. Ross. Results show that H. elongata will become extinct in the Rías Baixas by the end of the century, while B. bifurcata will persist and may occupy potential free space left by the decline in H. elongata.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aBifurcaria bifurcata 3aHimanthalia elongata 3ageographical distribution 3aheat tolerance 3alittoral zone 3amacroalgae 3amodels 3arefuge habitats 3aresearch 3asurface water temperature 3aIberian Peninsula 0aClimate change 0aIntertidal organisms 0aMechanistic species distribution model 0aDelft3D 0aCORDEX 0aCMPI5 0aRCP8.51 aMartínez, B.eauthoruDepartamento de Biología y Geología, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, E-28933, Móstoles, Madrid, Spain1 adeCastro, M.eauthoruEnvironmental Physics Laboratory (EphysLab), CIM-UVIGO, Universidade de Vigo, Edificio Campus da Auga, 32004, Ourense, Spain1 aViejo, R.M.eauthoruDepartamento de Biología y Geología, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, E-28933, Móstoles, Madrid, Spain1 aSousa, M.C.eauthoruCESAM, Physics Department, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, 3810-193, Portugal1 aGómez-Gesteira, M.eauthoruEnvironmental Physics Laboratory (EphysLab), CIM-UVIGO, Universidade de Vigo, Edificio Campus da Auga, 32004, Ourense, Spain0 tMarine environmental research.g2020 Oct., v. 161 p.105074-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)198240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.1050743Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:1982b0141-1136e105074  fMarine environmental research  aBatch:10142  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6070134469ExL  a2021-06-17  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/159769367929244171-00002-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0141113620302737.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/DA  aagid:7013446  a2020-10-25  a2021-06-1704937nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098035002800139040001800167100012700185245008900312300001400401520203300415592002802448593001802476650001302494650001902507650001902526650002002545650001402565650001102579650001402590650001502604650001102619650001602630651001602646651001802662653001402680653001502694653001302709653001902722653002502741653001402766700010602780700013902886700013603025700010803161700013803269700012703407773012003534787003303654787001803687787002103705856008803726912001203814914003103826914002503857916001503882917001103897918003603908935002203944949001503966953007003981954007104051955004504122961001304167974001704180983001504197984001504212991567181970742620221119164412.0190401e20171024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058203872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.08.0032doi  aagid:5820387-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, KyungdahmeauthoruSchool of Environmental and Forest Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-4115, USA10aCan a multi-model ensemble improve phenology predictions for climate change studies?  ap. 54-64.  aPredicting phenology, the timing of developmental events, is critical for understanding how plants respond to the changing climate. Many prediction models have been developed during the last decades, but their use has been limited because of incomplete understanding of internal processes and lack of observation datasets needed for calibration and validation. Dependency on species and locations further complicates the model selection procedure which is an essential part of phenology predictions. To overcome the limitations raised by using a single model, we propose a multi-model ensemble that simplifies model selection and provides competitive performance. We hypothesize that 1) no single individual model consistently outperforms the others and 2) an ensemble model performs equally as or better than any individual models. Nine individual models based on the concept of thermal-time accumulation and their ensembles were cross-validated with 137 datasets of four species collected from multiple locations and years in the United States and South Korea. Non-parametric tests concluded that the performance of a simple mean ensemble model was as good as the best individual model and outperformed the others. Differences between individual models were not statistically significant. The use of ensemble, however, does not preclude any bias in the interpretation caused by characteristics of the underlying models. When the ensemble was classified into groups: 1) with and 2) without chilling components, to assess spring phenology of flowering cherry species in the long-term projections, the predictions of two ensemble groups diverged considerably under RCP8.5 scenario. Our results suggest that a simple ensemble model can be a good phenology prediction tool for avoiding the pitfalls of model selection and reducing inherent uncertainties in climate change studies, but also highlight the importance of implementing the underlying mechanisms of key physiological processes into individual models used in an ensemble.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acherries 3aclimate change 3acold treatment 3adata collection 3aflowering 3amodels 3aphenology 3aprediction 3aspring 3auncertainty 3aSouth Korea 3aUnited States 0aPhenology 0aPrediction 0aEnsemble 0aClimate change 0aChilling requirement 0aFlowering1 aHsiao, JennifereauthoruDepartment of Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-1800, USA1 aJung, Myung-PyoeauthoruNational Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Rural Development Administration, Wanju 55365, Republic of Korea1 aChoi, In-TaeeauthoruNational Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Rural Development Administration, Wanju 55365, Republic of Korea1 aGlenn, D.

Any changes in soil erosion will have great effects on long-term planning of soil and water conservation in such a severely eroded basin. Rainfall erosivity describes the soil loss potential caused by rain, which can be expected to change in correspondence to changes in climate. This study was conducted to assess the potential effects of climate change on rainfall erosivity in the Yellow River basin. Two different rainfall scenarios were generated with the HadCM3 general circulation model for the years 2006 to 2035, 2036 to 2065, and 2066 to 2095. The statistics test showed that rainfall erosivity increased significantly in the Yellow River basin under both scenarios for all periods in the coming decades. The erosivity increase varied from scenario to scenario, and from period to period. Generally, increases in erosivity were less from southeast to northwest. The calculated precipitation elasticity of rainfall erosivity indicated that percent changes in rainfall erosivity were greater than percent changes in total precipitation by a factor of 1.2 to 1.4. The expected increases in precipitation require that more attention will be given to soil and water conservation practices such as vegetation rehabilitation and check-dam construction.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3asediment yield 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aclimate change 3alosses from soil 3arain 3awater erosion 3aChina 0aprecipitation 0aerosivity1 aNearing, M.A.1 aLiu, B.Y.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v.  48, no.  2 p.511-517x0001-23517nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl44720  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/54893Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44720b0001-2351c48d2e511  fTransactions of the ASAE  aissued  a20071113b20071210c00000000  aIND437034289ExL  aINDdRHFe2005/06/15  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20071113 20071210 00000000bIND RHF 2005/06/15  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:5489  a2007-12-10  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a370342803699nab a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003300098035002800131040001800159100010200177245006800279300001600347520084700363592002801210700010001238700010901338700009601447700011601543700011901659700008801778700012501866700008501991700009302076700012202169700012402291700011002415700016002525773014302685787003302828787002202861856007902883912001202962914004802974914001203022917001103034918003503045935002203080953003103102961001303133974001703146983001503163984001503178991567638320742620221119192750.0150727e20150710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033186712DNAL7 a10.1126/science.aaa70312doi  aagid:3318671-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerr, Jeremy T.eauthoruDepartment of Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada, K1N6N5.10aClimate change impacts on bumblebees converge across continents  ap. 177-180.  aFor many species, geographical ranges are expanding toward the poles in response to climate change, while remaining stable along range edges nearest the equator. Using long-term observations across Europe and North America over 110 years, we tested for climate change–related range shifts in bumblebee species across the full extents of their latitudinal and thermal limits and movements along elevation gradients. We found cross-continentally consistent trends in failures to track warming through time at species’ northern range limits, range losses from southern range limits, and shifts to higher elevations among southern species. These effects are independent of changing land uses or pesticide applications and underscore the need to test for climate impacts at both leading and trailing latitudinal and thermal limits for species.  aPublisher supplied data1 aPindar, AlanaeauthoruDepartment of Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada, K1N6N5.1 aGalpern, PauleauthoruFaculty of Environmental Design, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.1 aPacker, LaurenceeauthoruDepartment of Biology, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.1 aPotts, Simon G.eauthoruSchool of Agriculture, Policy and Development, The University of Reading, Reading, UK.1 aRoberts, Stuart M.eauthoruSchool of Agriculture, Policy and Development, The University of Reading, Reading, UK.1 aRasmont, PierreeauthoruDepartment of Zoology, Université de Mons, Mons, Belgium.1 aSchweiger, OlivereauthoruDepartment of Community Ecology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, Halle, Germany.1 aColla, Sheila R.eauthoruWildlife Preservation Canada, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.1 aRichardson, Leif L.eauthoruGund Institute, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA.1 aWagner, David L.eauthoruDepartment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA.1 aGall, Lawrence F.eauthoruPeabody Museum of Natural History, Entomology Division, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.1 aSikes, Derek S.eauthoruUniversity of Alaska Museum, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK, USA.1 aPantoja, AlbertoeauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Subarctic Agricultural Research Unit, Fairbanks, AK, USA.0 tScience.g2015 July 10, v. 349, no. 6244 p.177-180dAmerican Association for the Advancement of SciencewJournal:jnl44791x0036-80757nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 o(Journal)jnl4479140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa70313Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44791b0036-8075c349d6244e177  fScience  areview2 aHighWire Presseprovider5DNAL  aIND6033186719ExL  asci_349_6244_nlmxml.tar.gz  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:3318671  a2015-07-27  a2017-12-0803756nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008003300034016002200067024002100089035002600110040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181072000900190100001800199245011700217500002400334520174200358593001802100594002202118650001902140650002402159650002002183650002402203650002402227650002202251650002302273650002002296650001802316650002102334650002402355653002302379773012502402787001802527787003302545852000902578856011202587912001202699914007102711917001102782930003302793935002102826945002502847946001102872949001502883952005102898961001302949974001502962979002302977984001503000985010303015986001203118991567697480742620221119194147.0110121|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND444758392DNAL7 a10113/473982hdl  aagid:47398-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aJ100 0aF830 0aJ500 0aJ7001 aMazzola, Mark10aManagement of Resident Soil Microbial Community Structure and Function to Suppress Soilborne Disease Development  aIncludes references  aClimate change is likely to alter the distribution and severity of soilborne diseases affecting both intensive and low-input agricultural production systems. Naturally occurring disease suppressive soils have been documented in a variety of cropping systems, and in many instances the biological attributes contributing to suppressiveness have been identified. While these studies have often yielded an understanding of operative mechanisms leading to the suppressive state, significant difficulty has been realized in the transfer of this knowledge into the development of effective field-level disease control practices. Early efforts focused on the inundative application of individual or mixtures of microbial strains recovered from these systems, and known to function in specific soil suppressiveness. However, the introduction of biological agents into non-native soil ecosystems typically fails to yield commercially viable or consistent levels of disease control. Of late, greater emphasis has been placed on manipulation of the cropping system to manage resident beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms as a means to suppress soilborne plant pathogens. One such strategy is the cropping of specific plant species or genotypes, or the application of soil amendments with the goal of selectively enhancing disease suppressive microbial communities. This chapter will briefly review the existence of biologically functional disease suppressive soils, document the research history supporting the potential in managing microbial communities for disease control, describe methods available for the effective manipulation of bioactive populations, and describe specific examples demonstrating the effective application of the approach.  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article 3aclimate change 3asoil-borne diseases 3adisease control 3asoil microorganisms 3acommunity structure 3asuppressive soils 3abiological control 3asoil management 3agreen manures 3acropping systems 3aecological function 0aliterature reviews0 tClimate change and crop production / edited by Matthew P.

Geographic information systems (GIS) and crop simulation models are two powerful and highly complementary tools that are increasingly used for such predictive analyses. The role of both technologies in predicting future situations centres around extrapolation. For GIS, extrapolation from the past based on correlation in a very loose sense plays an important role. For crop models, extrapolation based on how known processes respond to factors of interest (i.e. simulation) is a key factor. GIS and crop models can be integrated, providing predictions that combine the spatial perspective of GIS with the stronger representation of temporal processes of simulation models. This chapter reviews the use of these two tools for predicting impacts of climate change and examining options for adaptation. Increasingly, downscaled outputs from a range of global general circulation models under differing future scenarios are used as key inputs for both tools. Examples are given for major food crops and key agricultural zones, with a bias towards tropical and subtropical regions. Consideration is also given to factors limiting efficient application of the tools to climate change research. Both technologies will see increasing use in climate change research and in applications of research in decision making. Credible studies of crop responses to climate involve dealing with large sets of data and potentially millions of simulations, especially if adaptation is considered. While the computational challenges are daunting, the greater challenge is how to devise efficient protocols for selecting the most meaningful scenarios, interpreting the results and summarizing outputs for decision makers.  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article 3aclimate change 3ageographic information systems 3acrop models 3asimulation models 3adecision support systems 3aprediction 3acase studies 3acrop production 3acarbon dioxide 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aambient temperature 3anitrogen fertilizers 3awild relatives 3agenetic variation 3aabiotic stress1 aWhite, Jeffrey0 tClimate change and crop production / edited by Matthew P.

Dwindling groundwater resources in the underlying Ogallala aquifer, future climate variability and frequent occurrences of droughts are major concerns for cotton production in this region. Assessing the impacts of climate change on cotton production enables development and evaluation of irrigation strategies for efficient utilization of groundwater resources in this region. In this study, the CROPGRO-Cotton module within the Cropping System Model (CSM) that is distributed with the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was evaluated for the THP region using measured data from cotton water use efficiency experiments at Halfway over a period of four years (2010–2013). Simulated seed cotton yield matched closely with observed yield during model calibration (average percent error of 0.1) and validation (average percent error of 6.5). The evaluated model was able to accurately simulate seed cotton yield under various irrigation strategies over the four growing seasons. The evaluated CROPGRO-Cotton model was later used to simulate the seed cotton yield under historic (1971–2000) and future (2041–2070) climate scenarios projected by three climate models. On an average, when compared to historic seed cotton yield, simulated future seed cotton yield across the THP decreased within a range of 4–17% when carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration was assumed to be constant at the current level (380ppm) under three climatic model scenarios. In contrast, when the CO2 concentration was assumed to increase from 493ppm (in year 2041) to 635ppm (in year 2070) according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A2 emission scenario, the simulated future average seed cotton yield in the THP region increased within a range of 14–29% as compared to historic average yield. When the irrigation amount was reduced by 40% (from 100% to 60%), the average (2041–2070) seed cotton yield decreased by 37% and 39% under the constant and increasing CO2 concentration scenarios, respectively. These results imply that cotton is sensitive to atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and cotton production in the THP could potentially withstand the effects of future climate variability under moderate increases in CO2 levels if irrigation water availability remains at current levels.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article  a803bjgilbertc2016-05-23dfedoraAdmine2016-05-23  eARIS manuscript 3aaquifers 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acotton 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3adecision support systems 3adrought 3agroundwater 3agrowing season 3airrigation management 3awater use efficiency 3aTexas 0aClimate models 0aClimate change 0aCrop model 0aDSSAT 0aIrrigation 0aSeed cotton yield1 aAle, SrinivasulueauthoruTexas A&M AgriLife Research (Texas A&M University System), Vernon, TX 76385, United States1 aBordovsky, James P.eauthoruTexas A&M AgriLife Research (Texas A&M University System), Halfway, TX 79072, United States1 aThorp, Kelly R.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Arid —Land Agricultural Research Center, Maricopa, AZ 58138, United States1 aModala, Naga R.eauthoruIntegraShare Solutioneering Inc., The Woodlands, TX 77380, United States1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0899-25611 aRajan, NithyaeauthoruDept of Soil and Crop Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 76384, United States1 aBarnes, Edward M.eauthoruAgricultural and Environmental Research, Cotton Incorporated, Cary, NC 27513, United States0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Jan. 31, v. 164 p.317-330dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.10.0113Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/622613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460c164d2e317  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:1333  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6000622619ExL  a2019-04-03  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00066-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S0378377415301323.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Adhikari2015%20-%20CROPGRO-Cotton%20deficit%20irrigation%20Texas.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:1333 reviewed on 2016-06-22T14:00:02Z  aagid:62261  a2019-04-03  a2019-04-03  ans966605129nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100014700182245012700329300001400456520231100470592002802781593001802809650000902827650003402836650001902870650001702889650002102906650002102927650001202948650001902960650002402979650002203003650002503025650001703050650001503067650002503082650001503107650002203122650002303144650001403167650001703181650001503198650002703213651001303240653002503253653001703278653001603295653001503311653001903326653001503345700013203360700015403492773011403646787003303760787001803793787002103811856008503832912001203917914004003929914003403969916001504003917001104018918003604029935002204065949001504087953007004102954007104172955004504243961001204288974001704300983001504317984001504332991567892310742620221119160942.0190403e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056187442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2016.07.0332doi  aagid:5618744-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlson, Matthew G.eauthoruSchool of Forestry and Natural Resources, University of Arkansas-Monticello, PO Box 3468, Monticello, AR 71655, USA10aDynamics of a temperate deciduous forest under landscape-scale management: Implications for adaptability to climate change  ap. 73-85.  aLandscape forest management is an approach to meeting diverse objectives that collectively span multiple spatial scales. It is critical that we understand the long-term effects of landscape management on the structure and composition of forest tree communities to ensure that these practices are sustainable. Furthermore, it is increasingly important to also consider effects of our management within the context of anticipated environmental changes, especially future climate. This study investigated two decades of tree community dynamics within a long-term, landscape-scale management experiment located in a temperate deciduous forest in southeastern Missouri, USA. This experiment tests three alternative landscape management systems: even-aged management (EAM), uneven-aged management (UAM), and no-harvest management (NHM). Specifically, we evaluated effects of landscape management alternatives on: (1) structural and compositional dynamics of the tree communities and (2) adaptability of the tree communities to projected climate change. Changes in the abundance of dominant species under these landscape management systems suggested a prevailing successional trend on these relatively xeric, oak-dominated landscapes. In the overstory layer, there was a decrease in the abundance of red oak species (Section Lobatae), mainly black oak (Quercus velutina Lam.) and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea Muenchh.), and an increase in white oak (Quercus alba L.) suggesting a shift to white oak dominance is underway. In the midstory and understory layers, flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.) abundance declined substantially, while maples (Acer spp. L.) and several minor species increased. Declines in shortleaf pine populations indicated that regeneration harvesting is not regenerating this species. Experiment-wide changes in tree community composition suggest that adaptability to projected future climate may have increased over the first two decades of the MOFEP experiment under all management systems and that diverse management objectives can be realized through active management, including adaptation to climate change. However, future research is needed to test this working hypothesis and to more fully evaluate the impacts of silviculture treatments within the context of projected climate.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aAcer 3aCornus florida subsp. florida 3aPinus echinata 3aQuercus alba 3aQuercus coccinea 3aQuercus velutina 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3adeciduous forests 3aeven-aged management 3aforest trees 3aharvesting 3alandscape management 3alandscapes 3along term effects 3amanagement systems 3aoverstory 3asilviculture 3aunderstory 3auneven-aged management 3aMissouri 0aLandscape management 0aSilviculture 0aOak forests 0aSuccession 0aClimate change 0aAdaptation1 aKnapp, Benjamin O.eauthoruDepartment of Forestry, University of Missouri-Columbia, 203 ABNR Building, Columbia, MO 65211, USA1 aKabrick, John M.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, University of Missouri-Columbia, 202 ABNR Building, Columbia, MO 65211, USA0 tForest ecology and management.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 387 p.73-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl901340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2016.07.0333Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl9013b0378-1127c387e73  fForest ecology and management  aBatch:1552  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6056187449ExL  a2019-04-03  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00065-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S0378112716303899.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:5618744  a2019-04-03  a2019-04-0304337nab a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100013100171245013100302300001800433520215800451592002802609593001802637650004102655650001902696650002102715650001102736650000902747650001602756650001902772650002302791650001302814650003302827650002502860650001002885650002202895650001502917650000902932650001102941650001602952650001202968650001202980700003402992700003703026700002803063773010103091787003303192787001803225787002203243856007303265912001203338914004603350914002603396916001503422917001103437918004303448935002203491949001503513953002803528961001203556962004803568974001703616983001503633984001503648991568110570742620221119172221.0150909e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040856462DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.129582doi  aagid:4085646-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBansal, SheeleauthoruUSDA‐Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3625 93rd Avenue SW, Olympia, WA, 98512, USA10aImpact of climate change on cold hardiness of Douglas‐fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii): environmental and genetic considerations  ap. 3814-3826.  aThe success of conifers over much of the world's terrestrial surface is largely attributable to their tolerance to cold stress (i.e., cold hardiness). Due to an increase in climate variability, climate change may reduce conifer cold hardiness, which in turn could impact ecosystem functioning and productivity in conifer‐dominated forests. The expression of cold hardiness is a product of environmental cues (E), genetic differentiation (G), and their interaction (G × E), although few studies have considered all components together. To better understand and manage for the impacts of climate change on conifer cold hardiness, we conducted a common garden experiment replicated in three test environments (cool, moderate, and warm) using 35 populations of coast Douglas‐fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) to test the hypotheses: (i) cool‐temperature cues in fall are necessary to trigger cold hardening, (ii) there is large genetic variation among populations in cold hardiness that can be predicted from seed‐source climate variables, (iii) observed differences among populations in cold hardiness in situ are dependent on effective environmental cues, and (iv) movement of seed sources from warmer to cooler climates will increase risk to cold injury. During fall 2012, we visually assessed cold damage of bud, needle, and stem tissues following artificial freeze tests. Cool‐temperature cues (e.g., degree hours below 2 °C) at the test sites were associated with cold hardening, which were minimal at the moderate test site owing to mild fall temperatures. Populations differed 3‐fold in cold hardiness, with winter minimum temperatures and fall frost dates as strong seed‐source climate predictors of cold hardiness, and with summer temperatures and aridity as secondary predictors. Seed‐source movement resulted in only modest increases in cold damage. Our findings indicate that increased fall temperatures delay cold hardening, warmer/drier summers confer a degree of cold hardiness, and seed‐source movement from warmer to cooler climates may be a viable option for adapting coniferous forest to future climate.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aPseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acoasts 3acold 3acold injury 3acold tolerance 3aconiferous forests 3aconifers 3adry environmental conditions 3aenvironmental impact 3afrost 3agenetic variation 3apopulation 3arisk 3asummer 3atemperature 3atesting 3atissues1 aSt. Clair, J.

For optimal irrigation reservoir operation and management, it is necessary to determine the duration of irrigation water shortages. Management of reservoir operation and irrigation scheduling should take into consideration essential variables that include the water supply in a reservoir and the water demand in the associated irrigation district. The agricultural water supply and demand show different patterns based on the variability and uncertainty of meteorological and hydrological phenomena. The duration of excessive water supply can be quantitatively determined through analysis of deviations and changes in the timing of agricultural water supply and demand. In this study, we introduce an approach to assess the vulnerable seasons of paddy irrigation to enable more effective operation and management of reservoirs. The vulnerable seasons were evaluated through comparison of the potential water supply capacity and irrigation water requirements based on water budget analysis via a time series change analysis. We have assessed the changing in the total duration and duration shifts of the vulnerable irrigation seasons for four agricultural reservoirs using past observed data (1981–2010) from meteorological stations maintained by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) and projected climate change scenarios (2011–2100) as depicted by the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) emission scenarios. For irrigation vulnerable seasons under both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, the results showed periods of significant increases in which total vulnerable seasons compared to the historical period; the longest duration of vulnerability occurred during the 2071–2100 period under the RCP 8.5. Identification of the vulnerable seasons for paddy irrigation can be applied in agricultural water management to more effectively manage reservoir operation during irrigation periods with climate changes.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3apaddies 3asupply balance 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3awater budget 3awater requirement 3awater shortages 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Taegoneauthor1 aHong, Eun-MieauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Environmental Microbial & Food Safety Laboratory, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, MD 20705, USA. silbern7@snu.ac.kr1 aChoi, Jin-Yongeauthor0 tWater.g2017 Sept. 26, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2168840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w91007353Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:21688b2073-4441c9d10  fWater  aBatch:2330  aissued2 aMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing Instituteeprovider5DNAL  aIND6065325969ExL  a2019-10-22  a/data/metadata/incoming/mdpinstitute/water-v09-i10-20171026.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/water-v09-i10-20171026.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:2330 reviewed on 2019-10-22T11:00:04Z  aagid:6532596  a2019-07-14  a2019-10-2202635nab a2200589 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024005300097024002100150035002600171040001800197072000900215072000900224072000900233100001900242245007200261300001200333500002400345520074300369593001801112593002001130650001501150650002101165650001901186650001201205650003001217700001601247773006601263787001801329787003301347787003001380787001801410852000901428856011201437856010301549912001201652914003801664914001501702917001101717930003301728935002101761945002501782946001301807949001501820952005101835961001401886974001501900984001501915985010301930986001202033991568363870742620221119185022.0090701e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442260112DNAL7 a10.2111/1551-501X(2008)30[3:CCARRR]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/315822hdl  aagid:31582-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aB200 0aF1301 aBrown, Joel R.10aClimate Change and Rangelands: Responding Rationally to Uncertainty  ap. 3-6.  aIncludes references  a
Rangelands are important to human survival since they provide needed livestocks and a host of ecosystem services technology or other land types cannot provide. Perhaps the most important of these services is the rangeland's ability to sequester and store greenhouse gases. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has produced their projections of changes in climate. The IPCC has come up with various projections, such as greatest warming over land, and at high northern latitudes, as well as a likely increase in extra tropical storm tracks an cyclone intensity. Such projections are informative, but there is a need for more detailed projections which can be used to formulate regionally and locally appropriate responses.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3arangelands 3arange management 3aclimate change 3adrought 3ainternational cooperation1 aThorpe, Jim0 tRangelands.g2008 June, v.  30, no.  3 p.3-6x1551-501X7nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)3143  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/315823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111/1551-501X(2008)30[3:CCARRR]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:3143b1551-501Xc30d3e3  fRangelands  aissued  a20090716b20090801c00000000  aIND442260119ExL  aINDdLYNe2009/07/16  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20090716 20090801 00000000bIND LYN 2009/07/16  aUSDA/NRCS  aagid:31582  a2009-08-01  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a422601103368nab a2200817 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024005400097024002100151035002600172040001800198072000900216072000900225072000900234072000900243072000900252072000900261100002400270245008600294300001400380500002400394500001500418520087400433593001801307593002001325650002101345650001701366650002301383650001601406650001501422650002201437650002101459650001701480650001901497650001801516650001601534650002601550650002101576650001601597650001601613650002101629650001901650651003101669651003001700653001801730700001801748773006801766787001801834787003301852787003001885787001801915852000901933856011201942856010402054912001202158914003902170914001502209917001102224930003302235935002102268945002502289946001302314949001502327952005102342961001202393974001502405984001502420985010302435986001202538991568382320742620221119185517.0090701e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442260142DNAL7 a10.2111/1551-501X(2008)30[29:CCIONA]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/315852hdl  aagid:31585-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aF130 0aP200 0aF900 0aP010 0aB2001 aChambers, Jeanne C.10aClimate Change Impacts on Northwestern and Intermountain United States Rangelands  ap. 29-33.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  a
The Pacific Northwest and Intermountain Region of the United States include the Great Basin, Columbia Plateau, Colorado Plateau, and surrounding areas. As for the region's rangelands, the lands are managed for such uses as nonextractive uses like terrestrial and aquatic habitat for wildlife and fisheries, as well as extractive uses like mineral, energy, timber and livestock production. Placed in terms of climate change, there will be changes in precipitation and temperature for the region, and this will rest upon the rate and magnitude of the increase in CO2 and other heat-trapping emissions. The effects will be different for each area of the region due to storm patterns and large differences in topography. This will then affect the region's species and ecosystems, mainly through changes in species distributions and reorganization of rangeland communities.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3arange management 3awater supply 3aevapotranspiration 3astream flow 3arangelands 3aplant communities 3awater management 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3anoxious weeds 3afire regime 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ainvasive species 3atemperature 3agroundwater 3aclimatic factors 3awater quantity 3aNorthwestern United States 3aIntermountain West region 0aprecipitation1 aPellant, Mike0 tRangelands.g2008 June, v.  30, no.  3 p.29-33x1551-501X7nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)3143  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/315853Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111/1551-501X(2008)30[29:CCIONA]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:3143b1551-501Xc30d3e29  fRangelands  aissued  a20090716b20090801c00000000  aIND442260149ExL  aINDdLYNe2009/07/16  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20090716 20090801 00000000bIND LYN 2009/07/16  aUSDA/FS  aagid:31585  a2009-08-01  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a422601404482nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002100115024002700136035002600163040001800189100002900207245011900236300001800355506017300373520180100546593001802347593002002365594002202385593002002407650001402427650003002441650001902471650003002490650001902520650002102539650001502560650002302575650002802598650002202626650001302648650002202661650002502683650001502708650001102723650001802734651001002752700003002762700003102792700002902823700002702852773009702879787003302976787001803009787002203027856011203049856007303161912001203234914003503246914003503281916001503316917001103331935002203342949001503364956008603379961000903465962003003474962004803504974001503552983001503567984001503582985011603597986001103713991568472060742620221214225018.0140804s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000594692DNAL7 a2998792aris7 a10113/594692hdl7 a10.1093/xb/eru0092doi  aagid:59469-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolley, H.

The contribution of each pathway to driver–productivity relationships depends on functional traits of dominant species. We used data from three experiments in Texas, USA, to assess the role of community dynamics in the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) response of C4 grasslands to two climate drivers applied singly: atmospheric CO2 enrichment and augmented summer precipitation. The ANPPdriver response differed among experiments because community responses and effects differed. ANPP increased by 80–120 g m–2 per 100 μl l–1 rise in CO2 in separate experiments with pasture and tallgrass prairie assemblages. Augmenting ambient precipitation by 128 mm during one summer month each year increased ANPP more in native than in exotic communities in a third experiment. The community effect accounted for 21–38% of the ANPP CO2 response in the prairie experiment but little of the response in the pasture experiment. The community response to CO2 was linked to species traits associated with greater soil water from reduced transpiration (e.g. greater height). Community effects on the ANPP CO2 response and the greater ANPP response of native than exotic communities to augmented precipitation depended on species differences in transpiration efficiency. These results indicate that feedbacks from community change influenced ANPP-driver responses. However, the species traits that regulated community effects on ANPP differed from the traits that determined how communities responded to drivers.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article  eARIS manuscript 3aC4 plants 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3agrasslands 3aindigenous species 3ainterspecific variation 3aintroduced plants 3apastures 3aplant communities 3aprimary productivity 3asoil water 3asummer 3atranspiration 3aTexas1 aDerner, Justin D.eauthor1 aJackson, Robert B.eauthor1 aWilsey, Brian J.eauthor1 aFay, Philip A.eauthor0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014, v. 65, no. 13 p.3415-3424x0022-0957; 1460-24317nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4465840uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/594693Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/xb/eru0093Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44658c65d13e3415  fJournal of experimental botany  aBatch:1770  aissued  aIND6000594699ExL  a2017-07-24  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/299879.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:1770 reviewed on 2017-07-24T04:00:03Z  aagid:59469  a2014-08-04  a2017-07-24  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans517907408nab a2200985 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002300115024002700138024001200165035002800177040001800205100014800223245010600371300001600477500002000493506017300513520198400686592002802670593001802698596006302716596006302779596010402842596010402946593002003050650001203070650003003082650001903112650002003131650001003151650001903161650002903180650001403209650001803223650001803241650001703259650001503276650003303291650002703324650002103351700011303372700014903485700011603634700024303750700010903993700010904102700010604211700010904317700010804426700011104534700010904645700011504754700014804869700011105017700014805128700011005276773012105386787003305507787001805540787002205558856011405580856007405694912001205768914004405780914002605824916001505850917001105865918004305876935002205919949001505941953005705956954006106013955003406074956008506108956008306193961000906276962003006285962004806315974001706363983001506380984001506395986001206410991568635810742620221214224058.0200207e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068316412DNAL7 a3672002aris7 a10113/68316412hdl7 a10.1111/gcb.148472doi8 ans18276  aagid:6831641-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, LinfengeauthoruCollege of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5831-883710aTerrestrial N2O emissions and related functional genes under climate change: A global meta‐analysis  ap. 931-943.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aNitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from soil contribute to global warming and are in turn substantially affected by climate change. However, climate change impacts on N₂O production across terrestrial ecosystems remain poorly understood. Here, we synthesized 46 published studies of N₂O fluxes and relevant soil functional genes (SFGs, that is, archaeal amoA, bacterial amoA, nosZ, narG, nirK and nirS) to assess their responses to increased temperature, increased or decreased precipitation amounts, and prolonged drought (no change in total precipitation but increase in precipitation intervals) in terrestrial ecosystem (i.e. grasslands, forests, shrublands, tundra and croplands). Across the data set, temperature increased N₂O emissions by 33%. However, the effects were highly variable across biomes, with strongest temperature responses in shrublands, variable responses in forests and negative responses in tundra. The warming methods employed also influenced the effects of temperature on N₂O emissions (most effectively induced by open‐top chambers). Whole‐day or whole‐year warming treatment significantly enhanced N₂O emissions, but daytime, nighttime or short‐season warming did not have significant effects. Regardless of biome, treatment method and season, increased precipitation promoted N₂O emission by an average of 55%, while decreased precipitation suppressed N₂O emission by 31%, predominantly driven by changes in soil moisture. The effect size of precipitation changes on nirS and nosZ showed a U‐shape relationship with soil moisture; further insight into biotic mechanisms underlying N₂O emission response to climate change remain limited by data availability, underlying a need for studies that report SFG. Our findings indicate that climate change substantially affects N₂O emission and highlights the urgent need to incorporate this strong feedback into most climate models for convincing projection of future climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aXDA19030202cCAS Strategic Priority Research Programme (A)  aXDA20050103cCAS Strategic Priority Research Programme (A)

54-70.  aPotential corn and winter-wheat grain, and potato crop yields in the United States Northeastern Seaboard Region (NESR) were simulated under current and future climate scenarios and two water management regimes to evaluate production shifts and land-based adaptation methods. Geospatial data consisting of historical climate, land use, soil, and crop management were coupled with a weather generator, three explanatory crop models, and spatially and temporally downscaled mid-century climate change scenarios to conduct the simulations at sub-county spatial resolution. Unadapted winter wheat yield increased 48% in response to mid-century projected climate changes, but corn grain declined 19% and potato 42% across the NESR, resulting in a net loss in caloric production. The contribution of the three crops to regional food production with respect to historical and mid-century climate conditions was evaluated on the basis of caloric content as a measure of yield capacity. The caloric content declined by 7 to 15% across the three commodities when averaged among all states in the region if no adaptation changes were implemented. Two land redistribution schemes were derived to compensate for this loss by re-allocating the existing land-base within each county to specific crops based on model predicted changes in productivity along with identifying additional increments of additional potential land. These approaches showed that less than 1.6% of the potentially available agricultural land base in the region would be needed to compensate for calorie losses due to climate change. These results qualify land redistribution as a pragmatic and direct adaptation strategy to the threat of climate change on regional food security.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aagricultural land 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acorn 3acrop management 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3aenergy content 3afood production 3afood security 3aland use 3apotatoes 3asoil 3aspatial data 3awater management 3awinter wheat 3aUnited States 0aFood production 0aLand redistribution 0aClimate change 0aCrop models 0aGeospatial modeling 0aCLU 0aCR 0aGCM 0aNESR 0aNL 0aPLUCC 0aPLUTOT 0aRCP 0aWL 0aTmin1 aFleisher, David H.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Adaptive Cropping Systems Laboratory, USDA-ARS, Beltsvillle, MD, United States1 aResop, Jonathan P.eauthoruUniversity of Maryland, Dept. of Geographical Sciences. 2181 Samuel J.

Climate models predict increased average maximum temperatures, days with temperatures exceeding 25 °C, and higher annual precipitation in the Northeast. These environmental changes combined with increased atmospheric CO₂ concentration are expected to either increase or decrease forage productivity depending on the crop, and may decrease protein content and forage digestibility. Winter damage to sensitive forage species may also increase. Predicted temperature increases are expected to reduce fertility in dairy cattle and heat stress-induced inflammation may limit energy available for productive functions. Additional loss in milk production due to decreased feed intake is estimated to be up to 1% of the projected annual milk production through 2100. The effects of climate change on the beef industry in the Northeast are expected to be minimal. Broiler production in the region may benefit from warmer winter and summer temperatures, but future housing will require greater insulation and ventilation fan capacity. Providing adequate housing and ventilation to offset climate changes will also be important for the layer industry and will likely increase the price of eggs. Climate change is expected to have an economic impact on the horse industry in the region through additional management of land and forage resources, building of shelters, and heat abatement at equine events. Increased temperatures and more intense storms will increase nutrient losses and gaseous emissions from animal manure. Uncertainties about how host animals, pathogens, and disease vectors will respond to climate change highlight the need for continued animal health monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aanimal health 3aanimal manures 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abeef industry 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adairy cattle 3adigestibility 3adisease vectors 3aeconomic impact 3aeggs 3aenergy 3afans (equipment) 3afeed intake 3aforage 3agas emissions 3aheat 3ahorses 3ainflammation 3ainsulating materials 3aland management 3amilk production 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apoultry production 3aprices 3aprotein content 3astorms 3asummer 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awinter 3aNortheastern United States1 aDegaetano, A.T.eauthoruCornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA1 aRotz, C.A.eauthoruPasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit, USDA-ARS, University Park, PA, USA1 aHoberg, E.eauthoruUSDA, Agricultural Research Service, Animal Parasitic Diseases Laboratory, Northeastern Area, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, MD, USA1 aSkinner, R.H.eauthoruPasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit, USDA-ARS, University Park, PA, USA1 aFelix, T.eauthoruThe Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA1 aLi, H.eauthoruUniversity of Delaware, Newark, NJ, USA1 aPatterson, P.H.eauthoruThe Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA1 aRoth, G.eauthoruThe Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA1 aHall, M.eauthoruThe Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA1 aOtt, T.L.eauthoruThe Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA1 aBaumgard, L.H.eauthoruIowa State University, Ames, IA, USA1 aStaniar, W.eauthoruThe Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA1 aHulet, R.M.eauthoruThe Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA1 aDell, C.J.eauthoruPasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit, USDA-ARS, University Park, PA, USA1 aBrito, A.F.eauthoruUniversity of New Hampshire, Durham, NC, USA1 aHollinger, D.Y.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Durham, NC, USA0 tClimatic change.g2018 Jan., v. 146, no. 1-2 p.33-45dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-2023-z3Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c146d1-2e33  fClimatic change  aBatch:1932  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6058991029ExL  a2018-06-19  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-01-31_05-58-48.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-146-1-2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FSUSDA/ARS  aagid:5899102  a2018-06-19  a2018-06-1905029nab a2200817 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098024003500136024004200171035002800213040001800241100014200259245016400401300001600565506002800581506006400609520143800673592002802111593001802139596004502157506003702202650001502239650003002254650001902284650001902303650002102322650001602343650002102359650001002380650001902390650002602409650001102435650001102446650002202457650001002479650001102489650001702500651001802517700012202535700011902657700009202776700010102868700011002969700011803079700010203197700012703299700010103426773011503527787003303642787001803675787002103693856008203714903002203796912001203818914004603830914002003876916001503896917001103911918002903922935002203951949001503973953006703988954005904055955003704114961001304151974001704164983001504181984001504196991568908160742620221207091048.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058991122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-017-1950-z2chorus7 a10.1007/s10584-017-1950-z2doi7 a10.1007/s10584-017-1950-z2chorusOpen  aagid:5899112-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStöckle, ClaudioO.eauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA. stockle@wsu.edu10aEvaluating opportunities for an increased role of winter crops as adaptation to climate change in dryland cropping systems of the U.S. Inland Pacific Northwest  ap. 247-261.  aResource is Open Access  aSpringer Science and Business Media LLC License Information  aThe long-term sustainability of wheat-based dryland cropping systems in the Inland Pacific Northwest (IPNW) of the United States depends on how these systems adapt to climate change. Climate models project warming with slight increases in winter precipitation but drier summers for the IPNW. These conditions combined with elevated atmospheric CO₂, which promote crop growth and improve transpiration-use efficiency, may be beneficial for cropping systems in the IPNW and may provide regional opportunities for agricultural diversification and intensification. Crop modeling simulation under future climatic conditions showed increased wheat productivity for the IPNW for most of the century. Water use by winter wheat was projected to decrease significantly in higher and intermediate precipitation zones and increase slightly in drier locations, but with winter crops utilizing significantly more water overall than spring crops. Crop diversification with inclusion of winter crops other than wheat is a possibility depending on agronomic and economic considerations, while substitution of winter for spring crops appeared feasible only in high precipitation areas. Increased weed pressure, higher pest populations, expanded ranges of biotic stressors, and agronomic, plant breeding, economic, technology, and other factors will influence what production systems eventually prevail under future climatic conditions in the region.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarid lands 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3acrop models 3acropping systems 3acrops 3aplant breeding 3aproduction technology 3aspring 3asummer 3awater utilization 3aweeds 3awinter 3awinter wheat 3aUnited States1 aHiggins, StewarteauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA1 aNelson, RogereauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA1 aAbatzoglou, JohneauthoruDepartment of Geography, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, USA1 aHuggins, DaveeauthoruNorthwest Sustainable Agroecosystems Research, USDA-ARS, Pullman, WA, USA1 aPan, WilliameauthoruDepartment of Crop and Soil Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA1 aKarimi, TinaeauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA1 aAntle, JohneauthoruDepartment of Applied Economics, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA1 aEigenbrode, Sanford D.eauthoruDepartment of Plant, Soil and Entomological Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, USA1 aBrooks, ErineauthoruDepartment of Biological Engineering, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, USA0 tClimatic change.g2018 Jan., v. 146, no. 1-2 p.247-261dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-1950-z3Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c146d1-2e247  fClimatic change  aBatch:1932  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6058991129ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-01-31_05-58-48.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-146-1-2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:5899112  a2018-06-19  a2020-03-0603593nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098024003800133035002800171040001800199100014000217245008900357300001400446520095700460592002801417593001801445650001701463650001901480650001001499650002301509650001201532650001101544650001501555650001401570650000901584650000901593650001601602700012801618700021101746700012401957700013702081700008302218773011302301787003302414787001802447787002102465856008202486912001202568914004502580914002002625916001502645917001102660918002902671935002202700949001502722953006702737954005902804955003702863961002002900974001702920983001502937984001502952991568909120742620221119220157.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058991072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-017-2070-52doi7 a10.1007/s10584-017-2070-52chorus  aagid:5899107-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoyce, LindaA.eauthoruUSDA FS Rocky Mountain Research Station, 240 West Prospect Road, Fort Collins, CO, 80526, USA. ljoyce@fs.fed.us10aNative and agricultural forests at risk to a changing climate in the Northern Plains  ap. 59-74.  aNative and agricultural forests in the Northern Plains provide ecosystem services that benefit human society—diversified agricultural systems, forest-based products, and rural vitality. The impacts of recent trends in temperature and disturbances are impairing the delivery of these services. Climate change projections identify future stressors of greater impact, placing at risk crops, soils, livestock, biodiversity, and agricultural and forest-based livelihoods. While these native and agricultural forests are also a viable option for providing mitigation and adaptation services to the Northern Plains, they themselves must be managed in terms of climate change risks. Because agricultural forests are planted systems, the primary approaches for reducing risks are through design, plant selection and management. For native forests, management, natural disturbances, and collaboration of multiple ownerships will be needed to address key risks.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3acrops 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3ahumans 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3arisk 3asoil 3atemperature1 aBentrup, GaryeauthoruUSDA Forest Service, National Agroforestry Center, 1945 N. 38th Street, Lincoln, NE, 68583-0822, USA1 aCheng, AntonyS.eauthoruDepartment of Forest and Rangeland Stewardship, Colorado Forest Restoration Institute, Colorado State University, 133 Forestry Bldg.

Among the opportunities are double-cropping and new crop options that may come with warmer temperatures and a longer frost-free period. However, prolonged periods of spring rains in recent years have delayed planting and offset the potentially beneficial longer frost-free period. Water management will be a serious challenge for Northeast farmers in the future, with projections for increased frequency of heavy rainfall events, as well as projections for more frequent summer water deficits than this historically humid region has experienced in the past. Adaptations to increase resilience to such changes include expanded irrigation capacity, modernized water monitoring and irrigation scheduling, farm drainage systems that collect excess rain into ponds for use as a water source during dry periods, and improved soil water holding capacity and drainage. Among the greatest vulnerabilities over the next several decades for the economically important perennial fruit crop industry of the region is an extended period of spring frost risk associated with warmer winter and early spring temperatures. Improved real-time frost warning systems, careful site selection for new plantings, and use of misting, wind machine, or other frost protection measures will be important adaptation strategies. Increased weed and pest pressure associated with longer growing seasons and warmer winters is another increasingly important challenge. Pro-active development of non-chemical control strategies, improved regional monitoring, and rapid-response plans for targeted control of invasive weeds and pests will be necessary.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3adouble cropping 3adrainage 3adrainage systems 3afarmers 3afarms 3afrost 3afrost protection 3agrowing season 3ahumid zones 3aindustry 3ainvasive species 3airrigation scheduling 3amonitoring 3aplanting 3aponds 3arain 3arisk 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aweed control 3aweeds 3awinter 3aNortheastern United States1 aDeGaetano, ArthurT.eauthoruDepartment of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Bradfield Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA1 aPeck, GregoryM.eauthoruSchool of Integrative Plant Science, Cornell University, 133 Plant Science Building, 236 Tower Road, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA1 aCarey, MaryeauthoruFarm Service Agency, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington D.C., USA1 aZiska, LewisH.eauthoruAgriculture Research Service, Crop Systems and Global Change, United States Department of Agriculture, 10300 Baltimore Avenue, Beltsville, MD, 20705, USA1 aLea-Cox, JohneauthoruDepartment of Plant Science and Landscape Architecture, University of Maryland, 2120 Plant Science Building, 4291 Field House Drive, College Park, MD, 20742, USA1 aKemanian, ArmenR.eauthoruDepartment of Plant Science, Pennsylvania State University, 116 Agriculture Sciences and Industry Building, University Park, PA, 16802, USA1 aHoffmann, MichaelP.eauthoruCornell Institute for Climate Smart Solutions, Cornell University, 105A Rice Hall, Tower Road, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA1 aHollinger, DavidY.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, 271 Mast Road, Durham, NH, 03824, USA0 tClimatic change.g2018 Jan., v. 146, no. 1-2 p.231-245dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-2109-73Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c146d1-2e231  fClimatic change  aBatch:1932  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6058991099ExL  a2018-06-19  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-01-31_05-58-48.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-146-1-2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FSUSDA/ARSUSDA/FSA  aagid:5899109  a2018-06-19  a2018-06-1906804nab a2200889 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098024003800133035002800171040001800199100014900217245013700366300001400503520300600517592002803523593001803551650002003569650001603589650001703605650001903622650002203641650001203663650001903675650002003694650002303714650001203737650001903749650001303768650002503781650001403806650001303820650002603833650001603859650001603875650001203891651001303903651002403916651001203940651001703952651001703969651001203986700011603998700007704114700008604191700010704277700008604384700012104470700008604591700008404677700012104761700007804882700012004960700008505080700008305165773011305248787003305361787001805394787002105412856008205433912001205515914004505527914002005572916001505592917001105607918002905618935002205647949001505669953006705684954005905751955003705810961002005847974001705867983001505884984001505899991568910050742620221119220132.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058991032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-017-2029-62doi7 a10.1007/s10584-017-2029-62chorus  aagid:5899103-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerner, JustineauthoruUSDA-ARS, 8408 Hildreth Road, Cheyenne, WY, 82009, USA.

The region contains 25% of the Nation’s beef cattle and approximately one-third of the confined beef cattle, as well as the largest remaining native prairie in the US—the Northern Mixedgrass Prairie. With rising atmospheric CO₂, the NGP is projected to experience warmer and longer growing seasons, greater climatic variability, and more extreme events (e.g., increased occurrence of large precipitation events). These climatic changes may affect livestock production both directly via physiological impacts on animals and indirectly via modifications to forage, invasion of undesirable plants, and increased exposure to parasites. This raises concerns about the vulnerability of grazing livestock operations and confined livestock operations to projected changes in mid- (2050) and late- (2085) twenty-first century climate. Our objectives are to (1) describe the NGP’s exposure to temperature and precipitation trends, inter-annual variability, and extreme events; (2) evaluate the sensitivity of beef cattle production to direct and indirect effects imposed by these projected climatic changes; and (3) provide a typology of adaptation strategies to minimize adverse consequences of projected changes and maximize beneficial consequences. Agricultural managers have developed considerable adaptive capacity to contend with environmental and economic variability. However, projected climatic changes, especially the increased frequency and magnitude of weather extremes, will require even greater adaptive capacity to maintain viable production systems. Consequently, regional vulnerability to projected climatic changes will be determined not only by ecological responses but also by the adaptive capacity of individual managers. Adaptive capacity in the NGP will differ from other regions, in part because projections suggest some opportunities for increased livestock production. Adaptations in both grazing and confined beef cattle systems will require enhanced decision-making skills capable of integrating biophysical, social, and economic considerations. Social learning networks that support integration of experimental and experiential knowledge—such as lessons learned from early adopters and involvement with science-based organizations—can help enhance decision-making and climate adaptation planning. Many adaptations have already been implemented by a subset of producers in this region, providing opportunities for assessment, further development, and greater adoption. Context-specific decision-making can also be enhanced through science-management partnerships, which aim to build adaptive capacity that recognizes multiple production and conservation/environmental goals.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aanimal products 3abeef cattle 3abiodiversity 3acarbon dioxide 3acattle production 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3agrazing 3agrowing season 3alearning 3amixed-grass prairies 3aparasites 3aplanning 3aproduction technology 3arural areas 3atemperature 3aweather 3aColorado 3aGreat Plains region 3aMontana 3aNorth Dakota 3aSouth Dakota 3aWyoming1 aBriske, DavideauthoruTexas A&M University, Centeq Bldg, Rm 130C, MS2120 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, USA1 aReeves, MatteauthoruUSDA-FS, 800 E.

However, the cumulative effect of small frequent fires can shape large landscapes, and fire-prone ecosystems are abundant in the tropics. Climate change has the potential to greatly expand fire-prone areas to moist and wet tropical forests and grasslands that have been traditionally less fire-prone, and to extend and create more temporal variability in fire seasons. We built a machine learning random forest classifier to analyze the relationship between climatic, socio-economic, and fire history data with fire occurrence and extent for the years 2003–2011 in Puerto Rico, nearly 35,000 fires. Using classifiers based on climate measurements alone, we found that the climate space is a reliable associate, if not a predictor, of fire occurrence and extent in this environment. We found a strong relationship between occurrence and a change from average weather conditions, and between extent and severity of weather conditions. The probability that the random forest classifiers will rank a positive example higher than a negative example is 0.8–0.89 in the classifiers for deciding if a fire occurs, and 0.64–0.69 in the classifiers for deciding if the fire is greater than 5 ha. Future climate projections of extreme seasons indicate increased potential for fire occurrence with larger extents.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aartificial intelligence 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3afire history 3afire weather 3afires 3agrasslands 3alandscapes 3aprobability 3asocioeconomics 3atemperate zones 3atemporal variation 3atropical forests 3atropics 3aCaribbean 3aPuerto Rico1 aGould, WilliamA.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, International Institute of Tropical Forestry, Río Piedras, Puerto Rico1 aMonmany, A.CarolinaeauthoruInstituto de Ecología Regional, CONICET-Universidad Nacional de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina1 aKhalyani, AzadHenareheauthoruDepartment of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA1 aQuiñones, MayaeauthoruUSDA Forest Service, International Institute of Tropical Forestry, Río Piedras, Puerto Rico1 aFain, StephenJ.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, International Institute of Tropical Forestry, Río Piedras, Puerto Rico1 aAndrade-Núñez, MariaJoséeauthoruDepartment of Environmental Science, University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras, Puerto Rico1 aGonzález, GrizelleeauthoruUSDA Forest Service, International Institute of Tropical Forestry, Río Piedras, Puerto Rico0 tClimatic change.g2018 Jan., v. 146, no. 1-2 p.117-131dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-2045-63Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c146d1-2e117  fClimatic change  aBatch:1932  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6058991049ExL  a2018-06-19  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-01-31_05-58-48.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-146-1-2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:5899104  a2018-06-19  a2018-06-1904473nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100020000179245006700379300001600446520174900462592002802211593001802239650001302257650001602270650002202286650001202308650001902320650002902339650001202368650001302380650002202393650002202415650001302437650001302450650001502463650000902478650002002487650001702507650002002524650001402544650001602558651001802574700017302592700017202765700017602937773011503113787003303228787001803261787002103279856008203300912001203382914004603394914002003440916001503460917001103475918002903486935002203515949001503537953006703552954005903619955003703678961001303715974001703728983001503745984001503760991568910990742620221119220225.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058991132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-017-1965-52doi  aagid:5899113-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteiner, JeanL.eauthoruUS Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Grazinglands Research Laboratory, 7207 W.

We assess agricultural vulnerabilities within this region to support identification and development of adaptation strategies at regional to local scales, where many management decisions are made. Exposure to the synergistic effects of warming, such as fewer and more intense precipitation events and greater overall weather variability, will uniquely affect rain-fed and irrigated cropping, high-value specialty crops, extensive and intensive livestock production, and forestry. Although the sensitivities of various agricultural sectors to climatic stressors can be difficult to identify at regional scales, we summarize that crops irrigated from the Ogallala aquifer possess a high sensitivity; rangeland beef cattle production a low sensitivity; and rain-fed crops, forestry, and specialty crops intermediate sensitivities. Numerous adaptation strategies have been identified, including drought contingency planning, increased soil health, improved forecasts and associated decision support tools, and implementation of policies and financial instruments for risk management. However, the extent to which these strategies are adopted is variable and influenced by both biophysical and socioeconomic considerations. Inadequate local- and regional-scale climate risk and resilience information suggests that climate vulnerability research and climate adaptation approaches need to include bottom-up approaches such as learning networks and peer-to-peer communication.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aaquifers 3abeef cattle 3acattle production 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision support systems 3adrought 3aforestry 3airrigated farming 3aissues and policy 3alearning 3aplanning 3arangelands 3arisk 3arisk management 3asoil quality 3aspecialty crops 3asynergism 3atemperature 3aUnited States1 aBriske, DavidD.eauthoruDepartment of Ecosystem Science and Management, Texas A&M University, Centeq Building, Room 130C, MS 2120 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, USA1 aBrown, DavidP.eauthoruUS Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Grazinglands Research Laboratory, 7207 W.

The extent of such consequences could be minimal if weed management, particularly the widespread and effective use of herbicides, minimizes any future risk; but, such an outcome assumes that [CO2] or climate change will not affect herbicide efficacy per se. Is this a fair assumption? While additional data are greatly desired, there is sufficient information currently available to begin an initial assessment of both the physical and biological constraints likely to occur before, during and following herbicide application. The assessment provided here, while preliminary, reviews a number of physical and biological interactions that are likely, overall, to significantly reduce herbicide efficacy. These interactions can range from climatic extremes that influence spray coverage and field access to direct effects of [CO2] or temperature on plant biochemistry and morphology. Identification of these mechanisms will be essential to both understand and strengthen weed management strategies associated with rising levels of [CO2] in the context of an uncertain and rapidly changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3ademographic statistics 3aherbicides 3apesticide application 3aplant biochemistry 3arisk 3aspray coverage 3atemperature 3aweed biology 3aweed control 0aClimate change 0aCO2 0aHerbicide management0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 231 p.304-309dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl3470940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aArticle  aJournal:jnl34709b0167-8809  fAgriculture, ecosystems & environment  aBatch:1424  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6053245199ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00031-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0167880916303826.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:5324519  a2019-03-18  a2022-09-0201945nab a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100013300180245012600313300001100439500002200450592002800472700013000500700010300630700013000733700012800863773009700991787003301088856008301121912001201204914002001216917001101236918002901247935002201276949001501298953006701313954005901380955003701439961001201476974001701488983001501505984001501520991569117650742620221119230951.0220930e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079507732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-022-03441-92doi  aagid:7950773-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSloggy, Matthew R.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Service, Riverside, CA, USA. matthew.sloggy@usda.gov10aCorrection to: Changing climate, changing minds?

Methods that livestock producers use to mitigate thermal stress—including modifications to animal management or housing—tend to increase production costs. We use operation‐level economic data coupled with finely‐scaled climate data to estimate how the local thermal environment affects the technical efficiency of dairies across the United States. We then use this information to estimate the possible decline in milk production in 2030 resulting from climate change‐induced heat stress under the simplifying assumptions that the production technology, location of production, and other factors are held constant. For four climate model scenarios, the results indicate modest heat‐stress‐related production declines by 2030, with the largest declines occurring in the southern states.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3acattle housing 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adairies 3aheat 3aheat stress 3alivestock 3ameat 3amilk production 3aoperating costs 3aproduction costs 3aproduction technology 3atemperature 3aUnited States1 aSneeringer, Stacyeauthor0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2014 July, v. 96, no. 4 p.1136-1156dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl4493240uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/596203Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aau0023Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44932c96d4e1136  fAmerican journal of agricultural economics  aBatch:668  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6000596209ExL  a2014-10-08  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/00029092_2014_96_4.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/00029092_2014_96_4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Key_AJAE_July-2014.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:668 annotated on 2014-09-23T10:55:30Z  aBatch:668 reviewed on 2014-10-08T11:00:02Z  aBatch:668 reviewed on 2014-10-08T16:00:02Z  aagid:59620  a2020-01-15  a2020-01-15  ans540104807nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100012000171245009300291300001800384500002000402520196600422592002802388593001802416650001502434650003702449650001602486650001302502650001202515650001902527650001902546650001802565650002202583650001202605650002202617650001102639650002202650650001402672650001402686650001802700650001402718650001002732651001602742651001602758700011702774700012702891700012003018700011103138700012403249700012303373773010603496787003303602787001803635787002203653856007303675912001203748914004603760914002603806916001503832917001103847918004303858935002203901949001503923953002803938961001203966962004803978974001704026983001504043984001504058991570288320742620221119202500.0171113e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058571972DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.138022doi  aagid:5857197-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, AlineeauthoruSwiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland10aRisk of genetic maladaptation due to climate change in three major European tree species  ap. 5358-5371.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTree populations usually show adaptations to their local environments as a result of natural selection. As climates change, populations can become locally maladapted and decline in fitness. Evaluating the expected degree of genetic maladaptation due to climate change will allow forest managers to assess forest vulnerability, and develop strategies to preserve forest health and productivity. We studied potential genetic maladaptation to future climates in three major European tree species, Norway spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba), and European beech (Fagus sylvatica). A common garden experiment was conducted to evaluate the quantitative genetic variation in growth and phenology of seedlings from 77 to 92 native populations of each species from across Switzerland. We used multivariate genecological models to associate population variation with past seed source climates, and to estimate relative risk of maladaptation to current and future climates based on key phenotypic traits and three regional climate projections within the A1B scenario. Current risks from climate change were similar to average risks from current seed transfer practices. For all three climate models, future risks increased in spruce and beech until the end of the century, but remained low in fir. Largest average risks associated with climate projections for the period 2061–2090 were found for spruce seedling height (0.64), and for beech bud break and leaf senescence (0.52 and 0.46). Future risks for spruce were high across Switzerland. However, areas of high risk were also found in drought‐prone regions for beech and in the southern Alps for fir. Genetic maladaptation to future climates is likely to become a problem for spruce and beech by the end of this century, but probably not for fir. Consequently, forest management strategies should be adjusted in the study area for spruce and beech to maintain productive and healthy forests in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aAbies alba 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aPicea abies 3abudbreak 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aforest health 3aforest management 3aforests 3agenetic variation 3aleaves 3anatural selection 3aphenology 3aphenotype 3arelative risk 3aseedlings 3atrees 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland1 aHowe, Glenn T.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA1 aSperisen, ChristopheauthoruSwiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland1 aBrang, PetereauthoruSwiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland1 aClair, J.

Disturbances may speed changes in community composition, but the interactions among climate change, disturbance and competitive interactions to produce range shifts are poorly understood. We used a physiologically based mechanistic landscape model to study these interactions in the northeastern United States. We designed a series of disturbance scenarios to represent varied disturbance regimes in terms of both disturbance extent and intensity. We simulated forest succession by incorporating climate change under a high‐emissions future, disturbances, seed dispersal, and competition using the landscape model parameterized with forest inventory data. Tree species range boundary shifts in the next century were quantified as the change in the location of the 5th (the trailing edge) and 95th (the leading edge) percentiles of the spatial distribution of simulated species. Simulated tree species range boundary shifts in New England over the next century were far below (usually <20 km) that required to track the velocity of temperature change (usually more than 110 km over 100 years) under a high‐emissions scenario. Simulated species` ranges shifted northward at both the leading edge (northern boundary) and trailing edge (southern boundary). Disturbances may expedite species' recruitment into new sites, but they had little effect on the velocity of simulated range boundary shifts. Range shifts at the trailing edge tended to be associated with photosynthetic capacity, competitive ability for light and seed dispersal ability, whereas shifts at the leading edge were associated only with photosynthetic capacity and competition for light. This study underscores the importance of understanding the role of interspecific competition and disturbance when studying tree range shifts.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3aforest inventory 3aforest succession 3ainterspecific competition 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aseed dispersal 3atemperature 3atrees 3aNew England region 3aNortheastern United States1 aDuveneck, Matthew J.eauthoruHarvard Forest, Harvard University, Petersham, MA, USA1 aGustafson, Eric J.eauthoruInstitute for Applied Ecosystem Studies, Northern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Rhinelander, WI, USA1 aSerra‐Diaz, Josep M.eauthor1 aThompson, Jonathan R.eauthoruHarvard Forest, Harvard University, Petersham, MA, USA0 tGlobal change biology.g2018 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.e335-e351dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.138473Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c24d1ee335  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:1908  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058849749ExL  a2018-03-09  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13541013_2018_24_1.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13541013_2018_24_1.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1908 reviewed on 2018-03-09T13:00:02Z  aagid:5884974  a2018-01-17  a2018-03-0905401nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002600098035002800124040001800152100017500170245012000345500002000465520256800485592002803053593001803081596007003099596004303169650001903212650002003231650001903251650002003270650002703290650001303317650001703330650002003347650001703367650001403384650002603398650001403424650001403438650001603452651001503468700015503483700013803638700010703776700016303883773010904046787003304155787001804188787002204206856007304228912001204301914004904313914001204362916001604374917001104390918004304401935002204444949001504466952001904481953005904500954006304559955003404622961001204656974001704668983001504685984001504700991570577860742620221119220850.0211202e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075876252DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.35252doi  aagid:7587625-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Kellen N.eauthoruPacific Northwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 11175 Auke Lake Way, Juneau, Alaska, 99801, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2532-465610aPersistent yet vulnerable: resurvey of an Abies ecotone reveals few differences but vulnerability to climate change  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate change is shifting forest tree species distributions across elevational and latitudinal gradients, and these changes are often pronounced at ecotones where species meet their climatic bounds and are replaced by other species. Using an extensive ecotone composed of lower‐montane white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana) and upper‐montane red fir (Abies magnifica var. magnifica) in the central Sierra Nevada range of California, USA, we (1) examined how the demographics of the ecotone have responded to recent climate using a field observational study and a historical dataset, (2) quantified climate drivers across species life stages using contemporary demographic data, and (3) tested the potential impacts of future climate on species‐specific seedling survival and growth in a fully factorial growth chamber experiment that varied temperature, growing season length, and water availability. A re‐examination of the ecotone midpoint after 35 yr suggested a reduction in A. concolor sapling and tree densities and a rise in A. magnifica proportional dominance between surveys. Seedling abundances across the ecotone indicated that A. magnifica tends to dominate the regeneration layer and currently forms an important component of the seedling community at elevations below those where A. magnifica saplings or trees begin to co‐dominate stands. Observational and experimental assessments suggest that temperature and precipitation serve as important drivers, differentiating A. concolor vs. A. magnifica distributions, and are primary stressors at the seedling stage. Seedlings of both species were adversely affected by experimental climate treatments, although A. concolor exhibited greater survival and a more conservative growth strategy under extreme climatic stress than A. magnifica. Projections indicate that historical climate conditions will rise by an amount greater than the ecotone’s current elevational extent by the end of the 21st century. Differential drivers of species abundances suggest that the projected climate will expand conditions that promote A. concolor abundance and impede A. magnifica abundance across the ecotone; however, disturbance activity and microclimatic conditions will also influence regeneration and overstory tree dynamics. Our study demonstrates the importance of quantifying species‐specific responses to climate and indicates that widespread regeneration failure may be one possible consequence in which species exhibit strong sensitivity to projected climate conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cCalifornia State University Agricultural Research Institute (ARI)  aCALY1603cUSDA NIFA McIntire‐Stennis 3aAbies concolor 3aAbies magnifica 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ademographic statistics 3aecotones 3aforest trees 3agrowth chambers 3amicroclimate 3amountains 3aobservational studies 3aoverstory 3aseedlings 3atemperature 3aCalifornia1 aO’Dean, EmilyeauthoruDepartment of Geological Sciences and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, 1664 N.

In this study, climate change impacts on irrigated grain corn, grain sorghum, winter wheat, and dryland (rainfed) winter wheat in the Palo Duro watershed of the Texas High Plains were assessed using an improved Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model with an enhanced irrigation representation of management allowed depletion (MAD) irrigation scheduling. Climate change analyses in this study used the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate projections of 11 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios of RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 during two 30-year periods of the middle (2040-2069) and end (2070-2099) of the 21ˢᵗ century to compare to a baseline period of 1970-1999. For the irrigated summer crops of corn and sorghum, all 11 GCMs predicted the reductions of future irrigation, crop evapotranspiration (ETc), and yields compared to the baseline period. According to an ensemble of 11 GCMs, the simulated reductions in average annual irrigation, ETc, and yield for the irrigated corn were 63%, 34%, and 13%, respectively, at the end of the 21ˢᵗ century under the severe emission scenario of RCP8.5. Those values were 80%, 34%, and 34% under the irrigated sorghum land use. As for the irrigated winter wheat, the decreases in future irrigation and ETc were also identified in all GCMs relative to the baseline period. However, irrigated wheat yields were increased in the future climate. The changes in dryland wheat ETc were consistent with the rainfall variation under all climate change scenarios. Generally, the future climate could benefit the dryland wheat yields. A large uncertainty was found for the surface runoff simulations under both irrigated and dryland wheat according to various GCMs.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aarid lands 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3agrain sorghum 3agreywater 3aland use 3ameteorology 3arain 3arunoff 3asummer 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3awinter wheat 3aTexas 0aSWAT 0aGCMs 0aRCPs 0aSorghum1 aMarek, Gary W.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, 300 Simmons Rd., Unit 10, Bushland, TX 79012, USA1 aMarek, Thomas H.eauthoruTexas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center at Amarillo, 6500 Amarillo Blvd. W., Amarillo, TX 79106, USA1 aPorter, Dana O.eauthoruTexas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center at Lubbock, 1102 E.

We used a species-specific, spatially explicit forest dynamic model LANDIS PRO, which incorporates site-scale tree species demography and competition, landscape-scale dispersal and disturbances, and regional-scale abiotic controls, to simulate the distribution shifts of four representative tree species with distinct biological traits in the central hardwood forest region of United States. Our results suggested that biological traits (e.g., dispersal capacity, maturation age) were important for determining tree species distribution shifts. Environmental heterogeneity, on average, reduced shift rates by 8% compared to perfect environmental conditions. The average distribution shift rates ranged from 24 to 200 m year−1 under climate change scenarios, implying that many tree species may not able to keep up with climate change because of limited dispersal capacity, long generation time, and environmental heterogeneity. We suggest that climate-distribution models should include species demographic processes (e.g., fecundity, dispersal, colonization), biological traits (e.g., dispersal capacity, maturation age), and environmental heterogeneity (e.g., habitat fragmentation) to improve future predictions of species distribution shifts in response to changing climates.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cForest Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3ademography 3adynamic models 3afecundity 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahardwood forests 3amortality 3atrees 3auncertainty1 aHe, Hong S.eauthor1 aThompson, Frank R.eauthor1 aSpetich, Martin A.eauthor1 aFraser, Jacob S.eauthor0 tScience of The Total Environment.dElsevier BVwJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl445540uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73325673Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.3533Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4455c634e1214  fScience of The Total Environment  aBatch:10130  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073325679ExL  a2022-02-22  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA/FSUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 0048-9697  aagid:7332567  aArticle missing volume number  a2022-09-06  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl04839nab a2200853 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098024003800139024004500177035002800222040001800250100017100268245014800439300001600587506002800603506003600631506007600667506003100743520176800774592002802542593001802570596004502588506003702633650001102670650001302681650001502694650001202709650001902721650001502740650001302755650001302768650002002781650000902801650001302810650001102823650001202834650001302846650001602859650002302875653001502898653001202913653001102925653002102936653001102957653001902968653001002987653002102997653001803018700016203036700011303198773010603311787003303417787001803450787002203468856008503490903002403575912001203599914003203611914002803643916001503671917001103686918003603697935002203733949001503755953006003770954006103830955003503891961001203926974001703938983001503955984001503970991571422870742620221207081217.0190214e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056540282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2017.03.0162chorus7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2017.03.0162doi7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2017.03.0162chorusOpen  aagid:5654028-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZielinski, William J.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station, Pacific Southwest Station, 1700 Bayview Drive, Arcata, CA 95521, United States10aNiche overlap of competing carnivores across climatic gradients and the conservation implications of climate change at geographic range margins  ap. 533-545.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThere is considerable interest in factors controlling “warm-edge” limits – the lower elevation and latitudinal edges of a species' range. Understanding whether conservation measures can mitigate anticipated change in climate requires consideration of future climate as well as species interactions. We explored niche relations of martens and fishers at their southern range margins to understand their spatial and temporal dynamics, and how they may be affected by climate change. We used large-scale non-invasive surveys and home range data from radio-marked individuals to explore the spatial dynamics of each species. Marten and fisher were allopatric in the northern/wetter regions but sympatric at intermediate latitudes with lower precipitation. In the driest/southernmost region only fishers occurred. Martens were not detected when annual precipitation was <900mm and rare where minimum temperatures exceeded 4°C. Fishers were absent where spring snow was >650mm. Classification trees, accounting for multivariate interactions, supported these results. Where sympatric, ~70% of a marten's home range overlapped with at least one fisher but martens tended to avoid this area. In sympatry, marten expanded their niche into areas with reduced snowpack, warmer temperatures and uncharacteristic lower elevation habitats. Future climate scenarios predict conditions that favor fishers, but our data suggest martens may be capable of shifting their niche somewhat to warmer and less snowy habitats. The conservation of interacting species at their warm range limits will require land managers be aware of interspecific tolerance, how each may respond uniquely to future climates, and how potential climate refugia can be integrated with existing habitat.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMartes 3aaltitude 3acarnivores 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahome range 3alatitude 3amanagers 3arefuge habitats 3asnow 3asnowpack 3aspring 3asurveys 3asympatry 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 0aCalifornia 0aClimate 0aFisher 0aGeographic range 0aMarten 0aMartes caurina 0aNiche 0aPekania pennanti 0aSierra Nevada1 aTucker, Jody M.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region, Sequoia National Forest, 1839 S.

(B.) microplus (Canestrini), which are endemic in Mexico, threatens the domestic livestock industry because these ticks vector the causal agents (Babesia bovis (Babes) (Piroplasmida: Babesidae) and B. bigemina Smith & Kilborne) of bovine babesiosis. The Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program safeguards the health of the national cattle herd preventing reemergence of bovine babesiosis by keeping the United States cattle fever tick-free. Free-living southern cattle tick, R. (B.) microplus, larvae have been collected from vegetation in the wildlife corridor of Cameron Co.- Willacy Co., Texas. Finding R. microplus larvae on vegetation complements reported infestations in wildlife hosts inhabiting the south Texas coastal plains. Substantial population expansion of native white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann) (Artiodactyla: Cervidae), and exotic nilgai antelope Boselaphus tragocamelus (Pallas) (Artiodactyla: Bovidae), both of which are definitive hosts for the cattle fever tick, support local tick populations independent of cattle. Increasing prevalence of native and exotic wild ungulates, widespread tick acaracide resistance, and climate change, undermine efforts to control bovine babesiosis. Thus, ecological conditions have changed since cattle fever ticks were eradicated from the United States in 1943 using cattle-centric control strategies. These changes complicate efforts by the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program to keep cattle in the United States free of these cattle fever disease vectors. Technologies that could be applied to integrated eradication efforts are discussed.  aPubAg article  a857bksichelmc2022-04-08damanda.xue2022-04-15  eARIS manuscript 3aBabesia bovis 3aBoselaphus tragocamelus 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aantelopes 3ababesiosis 3abiological corridors 3acattle 3acattle diseases 3aclimate change 3aherds 3alivestock and meat industry 3apopulation growth 3aticks 3avegetation 3awildlife 3aMexico 3aTexas1 aThomas, Donald B.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Cattle Fever Tick Research Laboratory, Edinburg, TX, USA1 aLohmeyer, Kimberly H.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock Insects Research Laboratory, Kerrville, TX, USA1 aTemeyer, Kevin B.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock Insects Research Laboratory, Kerrville, TX, USA0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2021 Oct. 8, v. 115, no. 1 p.39-55wJournal:jnl44731x0013-87467nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4473140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/saab0343Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44731b0013-8746c115d1e39  fAnnals of the Entomological Society of America  aBatch:10257  aissued  aIND6075539849ExL  a2022-04-18  dNAL-AP-2-clean  bUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1938-2901  aagid:7553984  a2021-11-01  a2022-04-1804008nab a2200589 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004200098035002800140040001800168100011700186245010600303300001400409500031400423520155500737593001802292593001802310595005602328650001902384650001902403650002102422650001102443650002102454650001102475650001502486650001302501650000902514650002602523650000902549650001702558700011802575700012302693700011702816773013502933787003303068787001803101787002203119856005503141912001203196914002103208914002303229916001503252917001103267935002203278949001503300961000903315962004703324974001703371983001503388984001503403991571743720742620221122160754.0200616s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069879362DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1258.112doi  aagid:6987936-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDussi, M.

To ensure a sufficient supply of healthy and nutritious food for the growing world population, agriculture will need to use the soil properly, use less oil, less water and less nitrogen. To understand the need to move toward a new paradigm, new approaches, criteria and ways of understanding reality from a multidimensional and ethical perspective are required. The present work aims to consolidate innovative learning processes with the purpose of strengthening capacities in university students that allow them to debate, establish agreement and propose solutions to agricultural production systems. At Comahue National University, a study was conducted with a population of students studying agroecology in 2014-2016. The students were divided into groups of four. Each group was assigned a regional productive unit (PU) to carry out field work using the sustainability indicators technique. From the results obtained, each group proposed suitable management alternatives to increase sustainability in the PU's. At the end of the project work, students were able to define the problems in each PU, propose and discuss diverse hypotheses, and propose different management alternatives, taking into account the critical points detected in the agroecosystems analyzed. Students showed high levels of motivation, interaction with stakeholders and solved specific agronomic problems, based on agroecology as an alternative response to industrial agriculture.  aPubAg article  dKeyed article  a556balice.allenc2020-06-19damanda.xue2020-06-27 3aagroecosystems 3aclimate change 3acollege students 3aethics 3ahigher education 3amodels 3amotivation 3anitrogen 3aoils 3aproduction technology 3asoil 3astakeholders1 aFlores, L.

Smallholder farmers are the most affected due to their low level of technology and poor adaptive capabilities. This study was conducted to investigate the social effects of climate change on smallholder farmers in Akinyele, Oyo State, Nigeria. Sixty respondents were randomly selected from three communities. Both qualitative (in-depth interview) and quantitative tools (structured interview schedule) were used for data collection. The results show that most respondents were aware of changes in climate parameters but most believed that climate change was an act of God. Without adaptation strategies, climate change will further exacerbate smallholder farmers' vulnerabilities, placing human health and wellbeing at risk, compromising their livelihoods and impeding sustainable rural development.  aPubAg article  dKeyed article  a556balice.allenc2020-06-19damanda.xue2020-06-27 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3afarmers 3ahuman health 3alivelihood 3arural development 3aNigeria1 aAkeredolu, M.eauthoruWinrock International, 2101 Riverfront Drive, Little Rock, AR 72202, USA1 aAdewale, O.

Two of the most ubiquitous stressors are climate change and non‐point source nutrient pollution. Agricultural conservation practices (ACPs, i.e. farming practices that reduce runoff, prevent erosion, and curb excessive nutrient loading) offer a potential means to mitigate the negative effects of non‐point source pollution on fish populations. However, our understanding of how ACP implementation amidst a changing climate will affect fish production in large ecosystems that receive substantial upstream sediment and nutrient inputs remains incomplete. Towards this end, we explored how anticipated climate change and the implementation of realistic ACPs might alter the recruitment dynamics of three fish populations (native walleye Sander vitreus and yellow perch Perca flavescens and invasive white perch Morone americana) in the highly productive, dynamic west basin of Lake Erie. We projected future (2020–2065) recruitment under different combinations of anticipated climate change (n = 2 levels) and ACP implementation (n = 4 levels) in the western Lake Erie catchment using predictive biological models driven by forecasted winter severity, spring warming rate, and Maumee River total phosphorus loads that were generated from linked climate, catchment‐hydrology, and agricultural‐practice‐simulation models. In general, our models projected reduced walleye and yellow perch recruitment whereas invasive white perch recruitment was projected to remain stable or increase relative to the recent past. Our modelling also suggests the potential for trade‐offs, as ACP implementation was projected to reduce yellow perch recruitment with anticipated climate change. Overall, our study presents a useful modelling framework to forecast fish recruitment in Lake Erie and elsewhere, as well as offering projections and new avenues of research that could help resource management agencies and policy‐makers develop adaptive and resilient management strategies in the face of anticipated climate and land‐management change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article

2 global general circulation models focusing on the decades of the 2030s and 2090s. We examined historical shifts in the location of crops and trends in the variability of U.S. average crop yields, finding that non-climatic forces have likely dominated the north and westward movement of crops and the trends in yield variability. For the simulated future climates we considered impacts on crops, grazing and pasture, livestock, pesticide use, irrigation water supply and demand, and the sensitivity to international trade assumptions, finding that the aggregate of these effects were positive for the U.S. consumer but negative, due to declining crop prices, for producers. We examined the effects of potential changes in El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and impacts on yield variability of changes in mean climate conditions. Increased losses occurred with ENSO intensity and frequency increases that could not be completely offset even if the events could be perfectly forecasted. Effects on yield variability of changes in mean temperatures were mixed. We also considered case study interactions of climate, agriculture, and the environment focusing on climate effects on nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay and groundwater depletion of the Edward's Aquifer that provides water for municipalities and agriculture to the San Antonio, Texas area. While only case studies, these results suggest environmental targets such as pumping limits and changes in farm practices tolimit nutrient run-off would need to be tightened if current environmental goals were to be achieved under the climate scenarios we examined  aPubAg article 3ahistory 3asimulation models 3aenvironmental impact 3aEl Nino 3aair temperature 3agroundwater 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3awater table 3aagriculture 3aenvironmental assessment 3apollution load 3aestuaries 3aprediction 3aTexas 3aChesapeake Bay 0aUnited States1 aTubiello, F.1 aMcCarl, B.1 aAbler, D.1 aDarwin, R.1 aFuglie, K.1 aHollinger, S.1 aIzaurralde, C.1 aJagtap, S.1 aJones, J.1 aMearns, L.1 aOjima, D.1 aPaul, E.1 aPaustian, K.1 aRiha, S.1 aRosenberg, N.1 aRosenzweig, C.0 tClimatic change.g2003 Mar., v.  57, no.  1-2 p.43-697nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/475193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10221033154243Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fClimatic change  aissued  a20110204b20110305c00000000  aIND444845619ExL  aINDdGAYe2011/02/03  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20110204 20110305 00000000bIND GAY 2011/02/03  aUSDA  aagid:47519  a2011-03-05  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a448456104849nab a2200853 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002100115024003600136024001100172035002600183040001800209100014000227245011800367300001600485506017300501520135800674592002802032593001802060594002202078595005002100593002002150650003102170650002602201650001102227650001202238650001902250650001502269650001102284650000902295650001302304650001602317650001602333650002102349650002402370651001302394651001502407651002102422653002602443653001902469653002102488653002002509700013802529700014102667700009302808700013802901773010003039787003303139787001803172787001903190856008203209856011203291912001203403914003703415914002503452916001503477917001103492918003603503935002203539949001503561953007003576954007103646955004503717956008603762961001303848962003003861962004803891974001503939983001503954984001503969986001103984991618813760742620221214224731.0190417e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000618352DNAL7 a3077692aris7 a10113/618352hdl7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2015.04.0042doi8 ans8917  aagid:61835-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElias, E.H.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico State University, PO Box 3003, MSC 3JER, Las Cruces, NM 88003, USA10aAssessing climate change impacts on water availability of snowmelt-dominated basins of the Upper Rio Grande basin  ap. 525-546.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aUpper Rio Grande, Colorado and New Mexico, USA.Climate change is predicted to further limit the water availability of the arid southwestern U.S. We use the snowmelt runoff model to evaluate impacts of climate change on snow covered area (SCA), streamflow timing and runoff volume. Simulations investigate four future conditions using models downscaled to existing climate stations. Twenty-four subbasins of the Upper Rio Grande containing appreciable snowmelt and a long-term gauging station are simulated.Future annual volume is 193–204millionm3 more to 448–476millionm3 less than the pre-climate change value of 2688millionm3. There is disparity between increased volume in wetter simulations (+7%) and decreased volume (−18%) in drier simulations. SCA on 1 April reduced by approximately 50% in all but the warmer/wetter climate. Peak flow is 14–24 days early in the future climates. Among the 24 subbasins there is considerable range in mean melt season SCA (−40% to −100%), total volume change (−30% to +57%) and runoff timing advancement indicating that climate change is best evaluated at the subbasin scale. Daily hydrographs show higher streamflow in March and April, but less from mid-May until the end of the water year. The large decrease in volume in May, June and July will compound water management challenges in the region.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article  bjgilbertc2016-02-19dfedoraAdmine2016-02-19  eARIS manuscript 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aSnowmelt Runoff Model 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahydrograph 3arunoff 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3astream flow 3atemperature 3awater management 3awatershed hydrology 3aColorado 3aNew Mexico 3aRio Grande River 0aSnowmelt runoff model 0aClimate change 0aUpper Rio Grande 0aWater resources1 aRango, A.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico State University, PO Box 3003, MSC 3JER, Las Cruces, NM 88003, USA1 aSteele, C.M.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico State University, PO Box 3003, MSC 3JER, Las Cruces, NM 88003, USA1 aMejia, J.F.eauthoruDesert Research Institute, 2215 Raggio Parkway, Reno, NV 89512, USA1 aSmith, R.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico State University, PO Box 3003, MSC 3JER, Las Cruces, NM 88003, USA0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Mar., v. 3 p.525-546dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2322940uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2015.04.0043Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/618353Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:23229b2214-5818c3e525  fJournal of hydrology  aBatch:1231  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6000618359ExL  a2021-06-22  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00118-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S2214581815000336.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/15-021.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:1231 reviewed on 2016-03-10T04:00:02Z  aagid:61835  a2019-04-17  a2020-10-19  ans891704533nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002100115024002600136035002600162040001800188100003100206245007900237300001800316500001500334506017300349520185000522593001802372593002002390593002002410650001902430650001002449650002102459650002302480650002902503650002002532650001902552650001202571650003102583650001902614650001902633650001902652650001902671650001502690650002002705650001502725650001802740650002002758653001502778700002802793700003102821700003002852773008702882787003302969787001803002787003003020787002203050856011203072856003903184912001203223914003103235914002603266917001103292935002203303949001503325956010403340961000903444962003003453962004803483962004703531974001503578983001503593984001503608985011703623986001103740991618873800742620221214223801.0130725s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006810712DNAL7 a2891022aris7 a10113/571092hdl7 a10.111/gcb.121822doi  aagid:57109-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDijkstra, Feike A.eauthor10aClimate change reduces the net sink of CH4 and N2O in a semiarid grassland  ap. 1816-1826.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aMethane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are potent greenhouse gases; their concentrations in the atmosphere have increased because of human activity. Soils are important sources and sinks of both gases where their production and consumption are largely regulated by biological processes. Climate change could alter these processes thereby affecting both rate and direction of their exchange with the atmosphere. We examined how a rise in atmospheric CO2 and temperature affected CH4 and N2O fluxes in a semiarid grassland during five growing seasons. We hypothesised that responses of CH4 and N2O fluxes to elevated CO2 and warming would be driven primarily by treatment effects on soil moisture. Previously we showed that elevated CO2 increased and warming decreased soil moisture in this grassland. We therefore expected that elevated CO2 and warming would have opposing effects on CH4 and N2O fluxes. Methane was taken up throughout the growing season in all five years. A bell-shaped relationship was observed with soil moisture in which the lowest CH4 uptake occurred at low and high soil moisture and the highest CH4 uptake at intermediate soil moisture. Both N2O emission and uptake occurred at our site with some years showing cumulative N2O emission and other years showing cumulative N2O uptake. Nitrous oxide fluxes were positively related to soil moisture with N2O uptake mostly occurring in dry soils and N2O emission in wet soils. In contrast to our hypothesis, both elevated CO2 and warming reduced the sink of CH4 and N2O expressed in CO2 equivalents (across five years by 7 and 11% for elevated CO2 and warming respectively). We conclude that CH4 and N2O fluxes are sensitive to soil moisture, and that in a future climate this semiarid grassland may become a smaller sink for atmospheric CH4 and N2O expressed in CO2-equivalents.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  eARIS manuscript 3acarbon dioxide 3agases 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aair temperature 3asemiarid zones 3amethane 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aglobal warming 3agrowing season 3asemiarid soils 3asoil treatment 3asoil water 3abiogeochemistry 3agrasslands 3anitrous oxide 3agrassland soils 0aatmosphere1 aMorgan, Jack A.eauthor1 aFollett, Ronald F.eauthor1 aLecain, Daniel R.eauthor0 tGlobal change biology.g2013, v. 19 p.1816-1826wJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/571093Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.111/gcb.12182  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021c19e1816  fGlobal change biology  aissued  aIND5006810719ExL  a2013-08-14  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Dijkstra%20et%20al%20GCB.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:304 annotated on 2013-08-06T15:18:25Z  aBatch:304 reviewed on 2013-08-14T14:00:02Z  aagid:57109  a2013-07-25  a2016-08-16  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.XXX 2012/012/28)  ans245504031nab a2200769 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001900098024001700117024002100134024004200155024001100197035002600208040001800234100003000252245010700282300001400389506017300403520120000576593001801776593002001794593002001814650001501834650002501849650002701874650001801901650001601919650002601935650001801961650002501979650001802004650001502022650002002037650001702057650001602074650001202090650002302102650002802125700002902153700002302182700004102205700002802246700003602274773011402310787003302424787001802457787003002475787002202505856011202527856005502639912001202694914003202706914002602738917001102764935002202775949001502797956012502812961000902937962003002946962004802976962004703024962004703071974001503118985011703133986001103250991618887450742620221214225009.0130808e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006848962DNAL7 a235047192pmid7 a2772602aris7 a10113/572082hdl7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02779.x2doi8 ans2591  aagid:57208-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Kessel, Chriseauthor10aClimate, duration, and N placement determine N2O emissions in reduced tillage systems: a meta-analysis  ap. 33-44.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aNo-tillage and reduced tillage (NT/RT) management practices are being promoted in agroecosystems to reduce erosion, sequester additional soil C and reduce production costs. The impact of NT/RT on N2O emissions, however, has been variable with both increases and decreases in emissions reported. Herein, we quantitatively synthesize studies on the short- and long-term impact of NT/RT on N2O emissions in humid and dry climatic zones with emissions expressed on both an area- and crop yield-scaled basis. A meta-analysis was conducted on 239 direct comparisons between conventional tillage (CT) and NT/RT. In contrast to earlier studies, averaged across all comparisons, NT/RT did not alter N2O emissions compared with CT. However, NT/RT significantly reduced N2O emissions in experiments >10 years, especially in dry climates. No significant correlation was found between soil texture and the effect of NT/RT on N2O emissions. When fertilizer-N was placed at ≥5 cm depth, NT/RT significantly reduced area-scaled N2O emissions, in particular under humid climatic conditions. Compared to CT under dry climatic conditions, yield-scaled N2O increased significantly (57%) when NT/RT was implemented  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  eARIS manuscript 3aarid zones 3aconventional tillage 3afertilizer application 3agas emissions 3ahumid zones 3along term experiments 3ameta-analysis 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3ano-tillage 3areduced tillage 3asoil texture 2aAgriculture 2aClimate 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aNitrous Oxidexanalysis1 aVenterea, Rodneyeauthor1 aSix, Johaneauthor1 aAdviento-Borbe, Maria Arleneeauthor1 aLinquist, Bruceeauthor1 avan Groenigen, Kees Janeauthor0 tGlobal change biology.g2013 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.33-44dBlackwell SciencewJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/572083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02779.x  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021c19d1e33  fGlobal change biology  aissued  aIND5006848969ExL  a2013-09-16  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/277260%20Climate%20and%20N%20Placement%20.....pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:337 annotated on 2013-08-28T10:40:40Z  aBatch:337 reviewed on 2013-09-16T13:00:02Z  aBatch:337 reviewed on 2013-09-16T15:00:02Z  aagid:57208  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.XXX 2012/012/28)  ans259105559nab a2200961 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002100098024004200119024001100161035002600172040001800198100012700216245009100343300001600434500002000450506017300470520131700643592002801960593001801988593002002006596008702026596003002113596005302143596004802196596004502244650002402289650001902313650002502332650001202357650001502369650003102384650001902415650001502434650002102449650001902470650001302489650001402502650001502516650001702531650001902548650002702567650001702594650001502611650001802626650002602644651001202670700012002682700010502802700010902907700012503016700010703141700011403248700015603362773011603518787003303634787001803667787003003685787002203715856011203737856008903849912001203938914002403950914002003974917001103994918004304005935002204048949001504070953005804085954006204143955003404205956011704239961001304356962003004369962004804399962004704447962004704494974001504541983001504556984001504571986001104586991618907340742620221117200001.0210417e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006916492DNAL7 a10113/573772hdl7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04349.x2doi8 ans2889  aagid:57377-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDijkstra, Feike A.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental Sciences, The University of Sydney, Eveleigh, NSW, 2015, Australia10aClimate change alters stoichiometry of phosphorus and nitrogen in a semiarid grassland  ap. 807-815.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aNitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are essential nutrients for primary producers and decomposers in terrestrial ecosystems. Although climate change affects terrestrial N cycling with important feedbacks to plant productivity and carbon sequestration, the impacts of climate change on the relative availability of N with respect to P remain highly uncertain. In a semiarid grassland in Wyoming, USA, we studied the effects of atmospheric CO₂ enrichment (to 600 ppmv) and warming (1.5/3.0°C above ambient temperature during the day/night) on plant, microbial and available soil pools of N and P. Elevated CO₂ increased P availability to plants and microbes relative to that of N, whereas warming reduced P availability relative to N. Across years and treatments, plant N : P ratios varied between 5 and 18 and were inversely related to soil moisture. Our results indicate that soil moisture is important in controlling P supply from inorganic sources, causing reduced P relative to N availability during dry periods. Both wetter soil conditions under elevated CO₂ and drier conditions with warming can further alter N : P. Although warming may alleviate N constraints under elevated CO₂, warming and drought can exacerbate P constraints on plant growth and microbial activity in this semiarid grassland.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  cUS Department of Agriculture (USDA)‐Agricultural Research Service Climate Change  cSoils & Emissions Program  aDEB# 1021559cthe US National Science Foundation  cUS Department of Energy's Office of Science  aFT100100779cAustralian Research Council 3aambient temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aglobal warming 3agrasslands 3amicrobial growth 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3asemiarid zones 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3asoil quality 3asoil water 3astoichiometry 3atrophic relationships 3aWyoming1 aPendall, EliseeauthoruDepartment of Botany and Program in Ecology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, 82071, USA1 aMorgan, Jack A.eauthoruRangeland Resources Research Unit, USDA‐ARS, Fort Collins, CO, 80526, USA1 aBlumenthal, Dana M.eauthoruRangeland Resources Research Unit, USDA‐ARS, Fort Collins, CO, 80526, USA1 aCarrillo, YolimaeauthoruDepartment of Environmental Sciences, The University of Sydney, Eveleigh, NSW, 2015, Australia1 aLeCain, Daniel R.eauthoruRangeland Resources Research Unit, USDA‐ARS, Fort Collins, CO, 80526, USA1 aFollett, Ronald F.eauthoruSoil, Plant, and Nutrient Research Unit, USDA‐ARS, Fort Collins, CO, 80526, USA1 aWilliams, David G.eauthoruDepartments of Botany, Ecosystem Science and Management, Program in Ecology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, 82071, USA0 tnew phytologist.g2012 Nov., v. 196, no. 3 p.807-815dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl4466540uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/573773Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04349.x3Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44665e1  fnew phytologist  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND5006916499ExL  a2013-09-23  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/0028646X_2012_196_3.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/0028646X_2012_196_3.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/116166_Dijkstra_et_al_New_Phytologist.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:352 annotated on 2013-09-16T13:08:56Z  aBatch:352 reviewed on 2013-09-23T13:00:02Z  aBatch:352 reviewed on 2013-09-23T18:00:02Z  aagid:57377  a2021-04-17  a2021-04-17  ans288903614nab a2200589 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003900097024002100136035002600157040001800183072000900201072000900210072000900219100001900228245008100247300001600328500002400344500001500368520175000383593001802133650002502151650001302176650001902189650001502208650001502223650002302238653002402261700001702285773006902302787001802371787003002389787003302419852000902452856011202461856008902573912001202662914002602674917001102700930003302711935002102744945002502765946001102790949001502801952005102816961001202867974001502879984001502894985010302909986001203012991619001200742620221117211750.0090424e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441945412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2005.09.0082doi7 a10113/286432hdl  aagid:28643-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aX330 0aX1001 aCoulson, David10aIndexing variability: A case study with climate change impacts on ecosystems  ap. 749-769.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWe developed a methodology to index statistical changes in the variance of ecological measures over time. While ecological indicators are used to assess ecosystem health, vulnerability, risk and damage to ecosystems, their primary focus has been on changes to the mean of the ecological state or process. Little work has been done on incorporating variability into ecological indices. The methodology developed here is based on the Modified Levene's test of variance and a moving block where an initial time period (block) of ecosystem behavior is compared to the moving block. This allows for the detection of not only shifts in variance but also the magnitude of the shift on a continuous basis. Our results compared well with the benchmarked results from the Centered Cumulative Sum of Squares Algorithm (CUSUM) for detection of variance changes in fixed time series. The output from this methodology is a continuous stream of parameters (significant variance shift, magnitude of the shift, and the direction of the variance shift) suitable for indexing variance or integrating into an index measuring ecosystem change. Results suggest that the block interval widths should be at least 50 and that a smoothing factor of five be used to avoid false positives. We used modeled vegetation carbon output to analyze the utility of the methodology, illustrating that different model assumptions and CO2 regimes affect the variability of the ecological response. The degree of risk resource managers may want to explore can be altered by choices in the block length, the length of the string used to smooth variance shifts, the assumption that the initial period has constant variance and the alpha levels used to determine statistical significance.  aPubAg article 3aenvironmental impact 3avariance 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aalgorithms 3astatistical models 0amathematical models1 aJoyce, Linda0 tEcological indicators.g2006 Nov., v.  6, no.  4 p.749-7697nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/286433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2005.09.0083Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fEcological indicators  aissued  a20090501b20090508c00000000  aIND441945419ExL  aINDdGAYe2009/05/01  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20090501 20090508 00000000bIND GAY 2009/05/01  aUSDA/FS  aagid:28643  a2009-05-22  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a419454104677nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100019800171245010700369300001800476500002000494520187000514592002802384593001802412596004902430596008702479650001702566650001002583650001202593650001902605650001202624650002402636650002002660650001502680650002402695650001402719650001602733650002502749651001802774700015702792700015402949700019603103773012203299787003303421787001803454787002203472856007303494912001203567914004503579914002603624916001503650917001103665918004303676935002203719949001503741953005703756954006103813955003403874961001203908962004803920974001703968983001503985984001504000991619004200742620221117211814.0190417e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063736352DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.145712doi  aagid:6373635-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorthrup, Joseph M.eauthoruForest Biodiversity Research Network, Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6319-413810aSynergistic effects of climate and land‐use change influence broad‐scale avian population declines  ap. 1561-1575.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate and land‐use changes are expected to be the primary drivers of future global biodiversity loss. Although theory suggests that these factors impact species synergistically, past studies have either focused on only one in isolation or have substituted space for time, which often results in confounding between drivers. Tests of synergistic effects require congruent time series on animal populations, climate change and land‐use change replicated across landscapes that span the gradient of correlations between the drivers of change. Using a unique time series of high‐resolution climate (measured as temperature and precipitation) and land‐use change (measured as forest change) data, we show that these drivers of global change act synergistically to influence forest bird population declines over 29 years in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Nearly half of the species examined had declined over this time. Populations declined most in response to loss of early seral and mature forest, with responses to loss of early seral forest amplified in landscapes that had warmed over time. In addition, birds declined more in response to loss of mature forest in areas that had dried over time. Climate change did not appear to impact populations in landscapes with limited habitat loss, except when those landscapes were initially warmer than the average landscape. Our results provide some of the first empirical evidence of synergistic effects of climate and land‐use change on animal population dynamics, suggesting accelerated loss of biodiversity in areas under pressure from multiple global change drivers. Furthermore, our findings suggest strong spatial variability in the impacts of climate change and highlight the need for future studies to evaluate multiple drivers simultaneously to avoid potential misattribution of effects.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cCollege of Forestry, Oregon State University  a1014995cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire Stennis project 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3apopulation dynamics 3asynergism 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aUnited States1 aRivers, James W.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5041-60021 aYang, ZhiqiangeauthoruForest Biodiversity Research Network, Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon1 aBetts, Matthew G.eauthoruForest Biodiversity Research Network, Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7100-25510 tGlobal change biology.g2019 May, v. 25, no. 5 p.1561-1575dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.145713Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c25d5e1561  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:2197  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6063736359ExL  a2019-05-14  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13541013_2019_25_5.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13541013_2019_25_5.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2197 reviewed on 2019-05-14T09:56:24Z  aagid:6373635  a2019-04-17  a2019-05-1403597nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003300097024002100130035002600151040001800177072000900195072000900204100015200213245010000365300001600465500001500481520123500496592002801731593001801759650001901777650001301796650001601809650001301825650002201838650001101860650001901871650001101890650001201901650001201913650001001925653001501935700003501950773009001985787001802075787003002093787003302123852000902156856011202165856008302277912001202360914002002372917001102392918002902403930003302432935002102465945002502486949001502511952005102526953003402577961001302611962004802624962004702672962004702719974001502766984001502781985010302796986001202899991619110160742620221122084914.0100225e200004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443315482DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10056698079452doi7 a10113/393272hdl  aagid:39327-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aX8001 aReilly, JohneauthoruJoint Program on the Science, Policy of Global Change Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139-4307, USA, 10aIrreversibility, Uncertainty, and Learning: Portraits of Adaptation to Long-Term Climate Change  ap. 253-278.  a2019-12-05  aThe usefulness of adaptation strategies to changing climate depends on the characteristics of the system that must adapt. Divergent views on whether climate change will seriously affect society and what society can do about it can be traced, in part, to divergent views on these characteristics of systems. Issues of scale and how impacts are measured are also important. We identify a set of fundamental characteristics of natural systems and social systems that help to make underlying assumptions in climate change adaptation studies explicit. These are: Short-run autonomous flexibility; short-run non-autonomous flexibility; knowledge and capacity to undertake short-run actions; long-run autonomous flexibility; long-run non-autonomous flexibility; and knowledge and capacity to plan for and undertake adaptations that require changes in long-lived assets. Applications to crop agriculture and ecosystems illustrate how these portraits can be used. We find that if empirical research is to resolve questions of adaptability, more careful specification of the exact measure of impact and far richer models of the process of adaptation, able to test implicit assumptions in much of the existing empirical research, are needed.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aagroecosystems 3aplanning 3auncertainty 3alearning 3asocial adjustment 3amodels 3aclimate change 3aassets 3asociety 3aclimate 3acrops 0aadaptation1 aSchimmelpfennig, Davideauthor0 tClimatic change.g2000 Apr., v. 45, no. 1 p.253-278dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10056698079453Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fClimatic change  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aIND443315489ExL  aINDdGAYe2010/03/12  a2016-09-13  a20100313 20100403 00000000bIND GAY 2010/03/12  aftp_PUB_14-08-27_06-16-47.zip  aUSDA/ERS  aBatch:665 annotated on 2014-09-16T13:32:33Z  aBatch:665 reviewed on 2014-10-14T16:00:01Z  aBatch:665 reviewed on 2014-10-15T04:00:03Z  aagid:39327  a2018-05-25  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a433154805705nab a2200829 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098024002200133024001900155035002800174040001800202100019500220245010700415300001100522506007600533520210700609592002802716593001802744506003702762650001402799650001202813650001202825650001702837650001902854650002702873650002202900650002102922650002202943650001202965650001702977650002502994650002903019650002103048650001403069650001503083650000903098650001403107650001103121650002203132650001903154650000903173651001103182700013203193700012903325700016203454700013203616700013503748700014003883700016904023773013504192787003304327787001804360787001904378856008104397912001204478914004004490914003404530916001504564917001104579918002904590935002204619949001504641953006704656954005604723955003704779961001204816974001704828983001504845984001504860991619688110742620221207130732.0181228e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061267482DNAL7 a10.1186/s13021-018-0099-z2doi7 aPMC61252632pmcid7 a301871462pmid  aagid:6126748-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmyth, C.

Our modeling frameworks include the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector, a framework for harvested wood products that estimates emissions based on product half-life decay times, and an account of marginal emission substitution benefits from the changes in use of wood products and bioenergy. Using a spatially explicit forest inventory with 16 ha pixels, we examine mitigation scenarios relating to forest management and wood use: increased harvesting efficiency; residue management for bioenergy; reduced harvest; reduced slashburning, and more longer-lived wood products. The primary reason for the spatially explicit approach at this coarse resolution was to estimate transportation distances associated with delivering harvest residues for heat and/or electricity production for local communities. RESULTS: Results demonstrated large differences among alternative scenarios, and from alternative assumptions about substitution benefits for fossil fuel-based energy and products which changed scenario rankings. Combining forest management activities with a wood-use scenario that generated more longer-lived products had the highest mitigation potential. CONCLUSIONS: The use of harvest residues to meet local energy demands in place of burning fossil fuels was found to be an effective scenario to reduce GHG emissions, along with scenarios that increased the utilization level for harvest, and increased the longevity of wood products. Substitution benefits from avoiding fossil fuels or emissions-intensive products were dependent on local circumstances for energy demand and fuel mix, and the assumed wood use for products. As projected future demand for biomass use in national GHG mitigation strategies could exceed sustainable biomass supply, analyses such as this can help identify biomass sources that achieve the greatest mitigation benefits.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3aburning 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aelectricity generation 3aforest industries 3aforest inventory 3aforest management 3aforests 3afossil fuels 3aglobal carbon budget 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahalf life 3aharvesting 3aheat 3alongevity 3amodels 3apollution control 3atransportation 3awood 3aCanada1 aSmiley, B.

The objective of this work was to evaluate forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios from 2018 to 2050 by applying a systems-based approach that accounts for net emissions across four interdependent components: (1) forest ecosystem, (2) land-use change, (3) harvested wood products, and (4) substitution benefits from using wood products and bioenergy. We assessed a range of land management and harvested wood product scenarios for two case studies in the U.S: coastal South Carolina and Northern Wisconsin. We integrated forest inventory and remotely-sensed disturbance data within a modelling framework consisting of a growth-and-yield driven ecosystem carbon model; a harvested wood products model that estimates emissions from commodity production, use and post-consumer treatment; and displacement factors to estimate avoided fossil fuel emissions. We estimated biophysical mitigation potential by comparing net emissions from land management and harvested wood products scenarios with a baseline (‘business as usual’) scenario. RESULTS: Baseline scenario results showed that the strength of the ecosystem carbon sink has been decreasing in the two sites due to age-related productivity declines and deforestation. Mitigation activities have the potential to lessen or delay the further reduction in the carbon sink. Results of the mitigation analysis indicated that scenarios reducing net forest area loss were most effective in South Carolina, while extending harvest rotations and increasing longer-lived wood products were most effective in Wisconsin. Scenarios aimed at increasing bioenergy use either increased or reduced net emissions within the 32-year analysis timeframe. CONCLUSIONS: It is critical to apply a systems approach to comprehensively assess net emissions from forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios. Although some scenarios produced a benefit by displacing emissions from fossil fuel energy or by substituting wood products for other materials, these benefits can be outweighed by increased carbon emissions in the forest or product systems. Maintaining forests as forests, extending rotations, and shifting commodities to longer-lived products had the strongest mitigation benefits over several decades. Carbon cycle impacts of bioenergy depend on timeframe, feedstocks, and alternative uses of biomass, and cannot be assumed carbon neutral.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon sinks 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3adeforestation 3aemissions 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest industries 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gases 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3awood products 3aSouth Carolina 3aWisconsin1 aBirdsey, RichardeauthoruUSDA Forest Service and Woods Hole Research Center, 149 Woods Hole Road, Falmouth, MA, 02540, USA1 aMascorro, Vanessa S.eauthoruConsultant to the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 393 St-Jacques Street West, Suite 200, Montreal, QC, H2Y 1N9, Canada1 aMagnan, MichaeleauthoruNatural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service, 506 Burnside Road West, Victoria, BC, V8Z 1M5, Canada1 aSmyth, Carolyn E.eauthoruNatural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service, 506 Burnside Road West, Victoria, BC, V8Z 1M5, Canada1 aOlguin, MarcelaeauthoruConsultant to the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 393 St-Jacques Street West, Suite 200, Montreal, QC, H2Y 1N9, Canada1 aKurz, Werner A.eauthoruNatural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service, 506 Burnside Road West, Victoria, BC, V8Z 1M5, Canada0 tCarbon balance and management.g2018 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.13-13dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:19518x1750-06807nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1951840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13021-018-0100-x3Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:19518b1750-0680c13d1e13  fCarbon balance and management  aBatch:2071  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6061267509ExL  a2020-05-13  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-12-28_05-34-59.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/13021-13-1.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6126750  a2018-12-28  a2020-09-2804546nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098035002800139040001800167100022400185245013000409500001900539520160600558592002802164593001802192596008802210596004502298650001902343650002002362650002502382650001802407650002002425650001602445650002202461650001202483650001402495650001602509650001502525650001102540650001102551650001402562651001002576653002402586653001502610653001802625653003002643653003002673653002002703700015302723700022002876773012403096787003303220787001803253787002203271856008803293912001203381914004503393914004003438916001603478917001103494918003603505935002203541949001503563953009103578954006103669955003503730961001203765974001703777983001503794984001503809991619871320742620221120055911.0200804e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069951822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.1080752doi  aagid:6995182-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, FengjuneauthoruResearch institute of Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Forest Protection Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration, Beijing 100091, China10aChange in the fire season pattern from bimodal to unimodal under climate change: The case of Daxing'anling in Northeast China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe length of the wildfire season has become longer in many regions around the world under climate change. This study investigated changes in fire season pattern (i.e., the number of separate periods of a year when wildfires are most likely to ignite, spread, and affect resources) and the contributions of climate change in Daxing'anling, Northeast China. An expanded fire dataset in both spatial and temporal converge from ground reporting was used. A comparison with satellite detected burned areas showed good agreement in spring, summer, and entire fire season. The results showed that the number of fires used to appear in a bimodal pattern with spring and fall peaks in the last century, but transitioned to a unimodal pattern peaked in summer in this century. This conversion was mainly resulted from a remarkable increase in summer lightning fires, which was in turned associated with warming in Daxing'anling. Another factor for the conversion was decreased spring nonlightning fire occurrence in the northwest subregion, where the conversion was the most significant. This decrease of fire was mainly associated with increased precipitation. The analysis of a compositional fire series, built as the log of the ratio of lightning to nonlightning fires, suggests that climate change was a major factor for the conversion of fire season pattern. The finding from this study indicates a need to adjust the fire prevention implementation timeline by including summer fires and to develop strategies to reduce the related risks to firefighter safety and forest ecosystem health in Daxing'anling.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aenvironmental health 3afire fighters 3afire prevention 3afire season 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3alightning 3ameteorology 3asatellites 3aspring 3asummer 3awildfires 3aChina 0aHistorical analysis 0aFire trend 0aWeather trend 0aCompositional fire series 0aFire-weather relationship 0aFire management1 aLiu, YongqiangeauthoruCenter for Forest Disturbance Science, USDA Forest Service, Athens, GA, United States1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8223-76151 aShu, LifueauthoruResearch institute of Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Forest Protection Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration, Beijing 100091, China0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 291 p.108075-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4325040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.1080753Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl43250b0168-1923c291e108075  fAgricultural and forest meteorology  aBatch:10117  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6069951829ExL  a2021-08-30  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/136918155820036786-00002-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0168192320301775.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6995182  a2020-08-04  a2021-08-3005364nab a2200829 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003600121024003900157035002800196040001800224100002700242245015000269506007600419506003100495520253700526592002803063593001803091596005103109596005203160596004703212506003703259650002603296650001203322650001903334650001103353650001403364650001503378650002103393650001103414650001403425650001203439650000903451650002903460650001503489650001103504650001103515650001303526650001203539650001103551650001603562651001903578651001403597651002203611700003103633700002903664700003203693773007203725787003303797787001803830787001903848856011403867856008303981912001204064914003104076914004104107917001104148918002704159935002204186949001504208952001904223955003404242961000904276962003004285962004704315974001704362979003404379984001504413985010604428991620105390742620221207102839.0220901e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073178362DNAL7 a10113/73178362hdl7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2021.1071882doi7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2021.1071882chorus  aagid:7317836-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavaud, Romaineauthor10aDynamic Energy Budget modelling to predict eastern oyster growth, reproduction, and mortality under river management and climate change scenarios  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aEastern oysters growing in deltaic Louisiana estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico must tolerate considerable salinity variation from natural climate variability (e.g., rainfall and stream run-off pushing isohalines offshore; tropical storms pushing isohalines inshore) and man-made diversions and siphons releasing freshwater from the Mississippi River. These salinity variations are predicted to increase with future climate change because of the increased frequency of stronger storms and also in response to proposed large-scale river diversions. Increased Mississippi River flow into coastal estuaries from river diversions, along with potential changes in rainfall and stream run-off from climate change will alter spatial and temporal salinity patterns. In this study we used an individual Dynamic Energy Budget model to predict growth and reproductive potential of eastern oysters across observed and simulated salinity gradients corresponding to different climate and river management scenarios. We used validated model outputs of salinity from a coupled hydrology-hydrodynamic model to assess the current impacts of Davis Pond diversion discharge on oysters located downstream. Under a high diversion discharge scenario oyster growth potential was reduced by 9%, 4%, and 1% in Upper, Mid, and Lower Bay locations, respectively, as compared to a limited discharge year. Reproductive outputs decreased by 34% and 2% in the Upper and Lower Bay locations, respectively, and increased by 2% at the Mid Bay site. In scenarios combining predicted increased temperature with the effect of diversions, all oysters located in the Upper and Mid Bay sites died due to severe summer conditions (high temperatures combined with low salinity). Overall, oysters in down-estuary locations, influenced by both estuarine river management and gulf conditions demonstrated significant tolerance to changing salinity and temperature conditions from diversions alone and when combined with climate change. In contrast, oysters located up-estuary, and exposed to more extreme salinity impacts from river management, demonstrated potentially lethal impacts through direct mortality, and reduced sustainability through decrease in reproductive output. These predictions at the individual level may translate into less sustainable populations in the most extreme scenarios; restoration and production plans may benefit from accounting for these impacts on reproductive output particularly as decision makers seek to restore critical oyster areas.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cLouisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries  cLouisiana Sea Grant, Louisiana State University  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrassostrea virginica 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amortality 3aoysters 3arain 3areproductive performance 3ariver flow 3arivers 3arunoff 3asalinity 3astreams 3asummer 3atemperature 3aGulf of Mexico 3aLouisiana 3aMississippi River1 aLa, Peyre Megan K.eauthor1 aJustic, Dubravkoeauthor1 aLa, Peyre Jerome F.eauthor0 tEstuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science.dElsevier BVx0272-77147nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1185140uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73178363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2021.1071883Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:11851c251e107188  fEstuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073178369ExL  a2022-04-22  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1096-0015  aagid:7317836  aArticle missing volume number  a2022-09-06  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl04122nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003900097024002000136035002500156040001800181072000900199072000900208072000900217072000900226100001800235245016500253300001400418500002400432500001500456520172000471593001802191650003002209650002202239650001902261650002402280650001702304650002602321650001902347650001902366650003102385650002102416650001802437650002502455651002602480653003102506653002902537653004902566653001902615700001502634700001902649773007002668787001802738787003002756787003302786852000902819856011102828856008902939912001203028914002503040917001103065930003303076935002103109945002503130946001103155949001503166952005103181961001203232974001403244984001503258985010303273986001203376991620249980742620221121032510.0071012e19990201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439601102DNAL7 a10.1016/S0304-3800(98)00200-22doi7 a10113/43552hdl  aagid:4355-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK001 0aW000 0aB2001 aIverson, L.R.10aModeling potential future individual tree-species distributions in the eastern United States under a climate change scenario: a case study with Pinus virginiana  ap. 77-93.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe are using a deterministic regression tree analysis model (DISTRIB) and a stochastic migration model (SHIFT) to examine potential distributions of approximately 66 individual species of eastern US trees under a 2xCO2 climate change scenario. This process is demonstrated for Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana). USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data for more than 100 000 plots and nearly 3 million trees east of the 100th meridian were analyzed and aggregated to the county level to provide species importance values for each of more than 2100 counties. County-level data also were compiled on climate, soils, land use, elevation, and spatial pattern. Regression tree analysis (RTA) was used to devise prediction rules from current species-environment relationships, which were then used to replicate the current distribution and predict the potential future distributions under two scenarios of climate change (2xCO2). RTA allows different variables to control importance value predictions at different regions, e.g. at the northern versus southern range limits of a species. RTA outputs represent the potential 'environmental envelope' shifts required by species, while the migration model predicts the more realistic shifts based on colonization probabilities from varying species abundances within a fragmented landscape. The model shows severely limited migration in regions of high forest fragmentation, particularly when the species is low in abundance near the range boundary. These tools are providing mechanisms for evaluating the relationships among various environmental and landscape factors associated with tree-species importance and potential migration in a changing global climate.  aPubAg article 3ageographical distribution 3alandscape ecology 3acarbon dioxide 3amathematical models 3aforest trees 3abotanical composition 3aphytogeography 3aclimate change 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aPinus virginiana 3aforest stands 3astochastic processes 3aEastern United States 0astochastic migration model 0aregression tree analysis 0adeterministic regression tree analysis model 0aforest ecology1 aPrasad, A.1 aSchwartz, M.W.0 tEcological modelling.g1999 Feb. 1, v.  115, no.  1 p.77-937nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/43553Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3800(98)00200-23Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fEcological modelling  aissued  a20071015b20071102c00000000  aIND439601109ExL  aINDdRHFe2007/10/15  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20071015 20071102 00000000bIND RHF 2007/10/15  aUSDA/FS  aagid:4355  a2007-11-02  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a396011004992nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004200098024003900140035002800179040001800207100015900225245009000384300001800474506007600492506003100568520152000599592002802119593001802147596006002165596003002225506003702255650002602292650001902318650001902337650001502356650002602371650002202397650002302419650002202442650002002464650002302484650001602507650002202523650001502545650001702560651001502577653001902592653002402611653001602635653001902651653002102670700025702691700015402948700015503102700011303257700013103370773012203501787003303623787001803656787002203674856008603696912001203782914003203794914002503826916001503851917001103866918003603877935002203913949001503935953009303950954006104043955003504104961001204139974001704151983001504168984001504183991620318640742620221207115417.0191025e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063926062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.04.0762chorus7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.04.0762doi  aagid:6392606-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontrone, AshtoneauthoruGraduate Program of Hydrologic Sciences, University of Nevada Reno, 1664 N.

We developed an approach to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on hydrology and vegetation communities of vernal pools by creating a mass-balance hydrologic model that is coupled to a statistical model of plant community distribution. The hydrologic and vegetative models were calibrated using field measurements from a vernal pool in northeastern California that experiences snow-dominated hydrology and is larger than vernal pools in more studied areas like Central California, but representative of other northern California vernal pools. Using downscaled data from global climate models, the coupled model suggests that warmer conditions will lead to the pool being inundated for a shorter time, but with little change in maximum depth. Reduced hydroperiods suggest possible declines in vernal pool specialist species with future climate change. The coupled model is an integrated approach for understanding the impact of altered environmental conditions on unique hydrology and plant community composition of vernal pool ecosystems, but the model approach could be improved with longer term data and by applying it at more sites to broaden the applicability of the approach and to enable better process representation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006959  cDesert Research Institute0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abotanical composition 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3ahydrologic models 3aindigenous species 3aplant communities 3aplants (botany) 3astatistical models 3atemperature 3aurban development 3avegetation 3avernal pools 3aCalifornia 0aEphemeral pool 0aHydrologic modeling 0aHydroperiod 0aWetland plants 0aSeasonal wetland1 aSaito, LaureleauthoruDepartment of Natural Resources and Environmental Science and Graduate Program of Hydrologic Sciences, University of Nevada Reno, 1664 N.

While the consequences of climate change for existing disturbance processes, like fires, are relatively well studied, emerging drivers of disturbance such as snow loss and subsequent mortality are much less documented. As the climate warms, a transition from winter snow to rain in high latitudes will cause significant changes in environmental conditions such as soil temperatures, historically buffered by snow cover. The Pacific coast of North America is an excellent test case, as mean winter temperatures are currently at the snow–rain threshold and have been warming for approximately 100 years post‐Little Ice Age. Increased mortality in a widespread tree species in the region has been linked to warmer winters and snow loss. Here, we present the first high‐resolution range map of this climate‐sensitive species, Callitropsis nootkatensis (yellow‐cedar), and document the magnitude and location of observed mortality across Canada and the United States. Snow cover loss related mortality spans approximately 10° latitude (half the native range of the species) and 7% of the overall species range and appears linked to this snow–rain transition across its range. Mortality is commonly >70% of basal area in affected areas, and more common where mean winter temperatures is at or above the snow–rain threshold (>0 °C mean winter temperature). Approximately 50% of areas with a currently suitable climate for the species (<−2 °C) are expected to warm beyond that threshold by the late 21st century. Regardless of climate change scenario, little of the range which is expected to remain suitable in the future (e.g., a climatic refugia) is in currently protected landscapes (<1–9%). These results are the first documentation of this type of emerging climate disturbance and highlight the difficulties of anticipating novel disturbance processes when planning for conservation and management.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aplanning 3asnowpack 3asoil temperature 3aXanthocyparis nootkatensis 3atrees 3arefuge habitats 3acoasts 3aconifers 3aforest damage 3aclimate 3awinter 3afires 3aclimate change 3amortality 3alandscapes 3aenvironmental factors 3asnow 3arain 3alatitude 3astand basal area 3aUnited States 3aCanada 0abasal area1 aHennon, Paul E.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, PNW Research Station, 11175 Auke Lake Way, Juneau, AK, 99801, USA1 aHarrington, Constance A.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, PNW Research Station, 3625 93rd Ave SW, Olympia, WA, 98512, USA1 aPopkin, Jamie R.eauthoruLittle Earth GIS Consulting Inc., PO Box 354, Lantzville, BC, V0R 2H0, Canada1 aKrapek, JohneauthoruSchool of Natural Resources and Extension, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK, 99775, USA1 aLamb, Melinda S.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Alaska Region, Juneau, AK, 99801, USA1 aOakes, Lauren E.eauthoruStanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA1 aSaunders, SarieauthoruCoast Area Research, BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations, Nanaimo, BC, V9T 6E9, Canada1 aZeglen, StefaneauthoruWest Coast Region, British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations, Nanaimo, BC, V9T 6E9, Canada0 tGlobal change biology.g2017 July, v. 23, no. 7 p.2903-2914dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.135553Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c23d7e2903  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:1908  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058782699ExL  a2018-03-09  a13541013_2017_23_7.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1908 reviewed on 2018-03-09T13:00:02Z  aagid:5878269  a2018-01-02  a2018-03-0904271nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100011000171245009200281300001800373500002000391520194200411592002802353593001802381650002502399650001202424650001902436650001902455650001202474650002202486650001402508650001502522650001102537650001402548650002602562650001602588650001902604650001502623650002002638650001102658650001602669700010602685700010402791700012202895773012303017787003303140787001803173787002203191856007303213912001203286914004503298914002603343916001503369917001103384918004303395935002203438949001503460953002703475961001203502962004803514974001703562983001503579984001503594991620971430742620221122175914.0180102e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058782342DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.135322doi  aagid:5878234-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, Bryce A.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Provo, UT, 84606, USA10aWill phenotypic plasticity affecting flowering phenology keep pace with climate change?  ap. 2499-2508.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRising temperatures have begun to shift flowering time, but it is unclear whether phenotypic plasticity can accommodate projected temperature change for this century. Evaluating clines in phenological traits and the extent and variation in plasticity can provide key information on assessing risk of maladaptation and developing strategies to mitigate climate change. In this study, flower phenology was examined in 52 populations of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) growing in three common gardens. Flowering date (anthesis) varied 91 days from late July to late November among gardens. Mixed‐effects modeling explained 79% of variation in flowering date, of which 46% could be assigned to plasticity and genetic variation in plasticity and 33% to genetics (conditional R² = 0.79, marginal R² = 0.33). Two environmental variables that explained the genetic variation were photoperiod and the onset of spring, the Julian date of accumulating degree‐days >5 °C reaching 100. The genetic variation was mapped for contemporary and future climates (decades 2060 and 2090), showing flower date change varies considerably across the landscape. Plasticity was estimated to accommodate, on average, a ±13‐day change in flowering date. However, the examination of genetic variation in plasticity suggests that the magnitude of plasticity could be affected by variation in the sensitivity to photoperiod and temperature. In a warmer common garden, lower‐latitude populations have greater plasticity (+16 days) compared to higher‐latitude populations (+10 days). Mapped climatypes of flowering date for contemporary and future climates illustrate the wide breadth of plasticity and large geographic overlap. Our research highlights the importance of integrating information on genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity and climatic niche modeling to evaluate plant responses and elucidate vulnerabilities to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aArtemisia tridentata 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aflowering date 3agardens 3agenetic variation 3aheat sums 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aphenology 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphotoperiod 3aplant response 3aplasticity 3arisk assessment 3aspring 3atemperature1 aChaney, LindsayeauthoruPlant and Wildlife Sciences, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602, USA1 aShaw, Nancy L.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Boise, ID, 83702, USA1 aStill, Shannon M.eauthoruUC Davis Arboretum, University of California, Davis, 1 Shields Ave., Davis, CA, 95616, USA0 tGlobal change biology.g2017 June, v. 23, no. 6 p.2499-2508dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.135323Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c23d6e2499  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:1908  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058782349ExL  a2018-03-09  a13541013_2017_23_6.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1908 reviewed on 2018-03-09T13:00:02Z  aagid:5878234  a2018-01-02  a2018-03-0904393nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100010200171245019700273300001800470500002000488520205500508592002802563593001802591650002602609650001102635650001202646650001902658650001102677650001502688650001002703650001402713650002202727650001302749650001902762650000902781650001302790650001102803650001402814650001602828650001102844650001602855650001002871650001102881700011202892700011103004773012303115787003303238787001803271787002203289856007303311912001203384914004503396914002603441916001503467917001103482918004303493935002203536949001503558953002703573961001203600962004803612974001703660983001503677984001503692991620971650742620221122180018.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058782972DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.136902doi  aagid:5878297-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFord, Kevin R.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, Olympia, WA, USA10aPhotoperiod cues and patterns of genetic variation limit phenological responses to climate change in warm parts of species’ range: Modeling diameter‐growth cessation in coast Douglas‐fir  ap. 3348-3362.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe phenology of diameter‐growth cessation in trees will likely play a key role in mediating species and ecosystem responses to climate change. A common expectation is that warming will delay cessation, but the environmental and genetic influences on this process are poorly understood. We modeled the effects of temperature, photoperiod, and seed‐source climate on diameter‐growth‐cessation timing in coast Douglas‐fir (an ecologically and economically vital tree) using high‐frequency growth measurements across broad environmental gradients for a range of genotypes from different seed sources. Our model suggests that cool temperatures or short photoperiods can induce cessation in autumn. At cool locations (high latitude and elevation), cessation seems to be induced primarily by low temperatures in early autumn (under relatively long photoperiods), so warming will likely delay cessation and extend the growing season. But at warm locations (low latitude or elevation), cessation seems to be induced primarily by short photoperiods later in autumn, so warming will likely lead to only slight extensions of the growing season, reflecting photoperiod limitations on phenological shifts. Trees from seed sources experiencing frequent frosts in autumn or early winter tended to cease growth earlier in the autumn, potentially as an adaptation to avoid frost. Thus, gene flow into populations in warm locations with little frost will likely have limited potential to delay mean cessation dates because these populations already cease growth relatively late. In addition, data from an abnormal heat wave suggested that very high temperatures during long photoperiods in early summer might also induce cessation. Climate change could make these conditions more common in warm locations, leading to much earlier cessation. Thus, photoperiod cues, patterns of genetic variation, and summer heat waves could limit the capacity of coast Douglas‐fir to extend its growing season in response to climate change in the warm parts of its range.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aautumn 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3afrost 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agrowing season 3aheat 3alatitude 3amodels 3aphenology 3aphotoperiod 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrees 3awinter1 aHarrington, Constance A.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, Olympia, WA, USA1 aSt. Clair, J.

Metrics of climate change, particularly rates and spatial patterns of climatic alteration, can help assess potential threats. Here, we perform a continent‐wide climate change vulnerability assessment whereby we compare the baseline climate of the protected area network in North America (Canada, United States, México—NAM) to the projected end‐of‐century climate (2071–2100). We estimated the projected pace at which climatic conditions may redistribute across NAM (i.e., climate velocity), and identified future nearest climate analogs to quantify patterns of climate relocation within, among, and outside protected areas. Also, we interpret climatic relocation patterns in terms of associated land‐cover types. Our analysis suggests that the conservation capacity of the NAM protection network is likely to be severely compromised by a changing climate. The majority of protected areas (~80%) might be exposed to high rates of climate displacement that could promote important shifts in species abundance or distribution. A small fraction of protected areas (<10%) could be critical for future conservation plans, as they will host climates that represent analogs of conditions currently characterizing almost a fifth of the protected areas across NAM. However, the majority of nearest climatic analogs for protected areas are in nonprotected locations. Therefore, unprotected landscapes could pose additional threats, beyond climate forcing itself, as sensitive biota may have to migrate farther than what is prescribed by the climate velocity to reach a protected area destination. To mitigate future threats to the conservation capacity of the NAM protected area network, conservation plans will need to capitalize on opportunities provided by the existing availability of natural land‐cover types outside the current network of NAM protected areas.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aconservation areas 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3aradiative forcing 3arisk assessment 3aCanada 3aUnited States1 aParisien, Marc‐AndréeauthoruNorthern Forestry Centre, Canadian Forest Service, Natural Resources Canada, Edmonton, AB, Canada1 aParks, Sean A.eauthoruAldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, Rocky Mountain Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Missoula, MT, USA1 aMoritz, Max A.eauthoruDivision of Ecosystem Sciences, Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA1 aMiller, CaroleauthoruAldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, Rocky Mountain Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Missoula, MT, USA0 tGlobal change biology.g2017 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.3219-3230dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.136633Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c23d8e3219  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:1908  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058782819ExL  a2018-03-09  a13541013_2017_23_8.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1908 reviewed on 2018-03-09T13:00:02Z  aagid:5878281  a2018-01-02  a2018-03-0903701nab a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100002600171245007200197300001800269500002000287520185500307592002802162593001802190650001002208650001202218650001902230650003002249650001102279700014802290700003202438700012102470773012302591787003302714787001802747787002202765856007302787912001202860914004502872914002602917916001502943917001102958918004302969935002203012949001503034953002703049961001203076962004803088974001703136983001503153984001503168991620983340742620221120053959.0180102e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058781642DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.134782doi  aagid:5878164-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRalston, Joeleauthor10aPopulation trends influence species ability to track climate change  ap. 1390-1399.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aShifts of distributions have been attributed to species tracking their fundamental climate niches through space. However, several studies have now demonstrated that niche tracking is imperfect, that species’ climate niches may vary with population trends, and that geographic distributions may lag behind rapid climate change. These reports of imperfect niche tracking imply shifts in species’ realized climate niches. We argue that quantifying climate niche shifts and analyzing them for a suite of species reveal general patterns of niche shifts and the factors affecting species’ ability to track climate change. We analyzed changes in realized climate niche between 1984 and 2012 for 46 species of North American birds in relation to population trends in an effort to determine whether species differ in the ability to track climate change and whether differences in niche tracking are related to population trends. We found that increasingly abundant species tended to show greater levels of niche expansion (climate space occupied in 2012 but not in 1980) compared to declining species. Declining species had significantly greater niche unfilling (climate space occupied in 1980 but not in 2012) compared to increasing species due to an inability to colonize new sites beyond their range peripheries after climate had changed at sites of occurrence. Increasing species, conversely, were better able to colonize new sites and therefore showed very little niche unfilling. Our results indicate that species with increasing trends are better able to geographically track climate change compared to declining species, which exhibited lags relative to changes in climate. These findings have important implications for understanding past changes in distribution, as well as modeling dynamic species distributions in the face of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abirds 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ageographical distribution 3aniches1 aDeLuca, William V.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental Conservation, University of Massachusetts, 160 Holdsworth Hall, Amherst, MA, 01003, USA1 aFeldman, Richard E.eauthor1 aKing, David I.eauthoruNorthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 201 Holdsworth Hall, Amherst, MA, 01003, USA0 tGlobal change biology.g2017 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.1390-1399dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.134783Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c23d4e1390  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:1908  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058781649ExL  a2018-03-09  a13541013_2017_23_4.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1908 reviewed on 2018-03-09T13:00:02Z  aagid:5878164  a2018-01-02  a2018-03-0905123nab a2200877 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004000098024003700138024004400175035002800219040001800247100011700265245014000382300001600522506007600538506003100614520193600645592002802581593001802609596008302627506003702710650004102747650001202788650001902800650001902819650002502838650000902863650001502872650001402887650002002901650001502921650000902936650002002945650002402965650001102989650001903000650001403019650001303033650001603046650001603062650001503078651001603093653001903109653001303128653002203141653001603163653001503179700011503194700005903309700004903368773012803417787003303545787001803578787002103596856008403617856004503701912001203746914004103758914003403799916001503833917001103848918003603859935002203895949001503917953007003932954007104002955004504073961001604118962004704134962001704181974001704198983001504215984001504230991621146850742620221215142819.0190403e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052628242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0052chorus7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0052doi7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0052chorusOpen  aagid:5262824-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParajuli, P.B.eauthoruDepartment of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Mississippi State University, USA10aAssessing the impacts of climate change and tillage practices on stream flow, crop and sediment yields from the Mississippi River Basin  ap. 112-124.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThis study evaluated climate change impacts on stream flow, crop and sediment yields from three different tillage systems (conventional, reduced 1–close to conservation, and reduced 2–close to no-till), in the Big Sunflower River Watershed (BSRW) in Mississippi. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was applied to the BSRW using observed stream flow and crop yields data. The model was calibrated and validated successfully using monthly stream flow data (2001–2011).The model performances showed the regression coefficient (R2) from 0.72 to 0.82 and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency index (NSE) from 0.70 to 0.81 for streamflow; R2 from 0.40 to 0.50 and NSE from 0.72 to 0.86 for corn yields; and R2 from 0.43 to 0.59 and NSE from 0.48 to 0.57 for soybeans yields. The Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG), was used to generate future climate scenarios. The SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) A1B, A2, and B1 climate change scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were simulated for the mid (2046–2065) and late (2080–2099) century. Model outputs showed slight differences among tillage practices for corn and soybean yields. However, model simulated sediment yield results indicated a large difference among the tillage practices from the corn and soybean crop fields. The simulated future average maximum temperature showed as high as 4.8°C increase in the BSRW. Monthly precipitation patterns will remain un-changed based on simulated future climate scenarios except for an increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events occurring in the watershed. On average, the effect of climate change and tillage practice together did not show notable changes to the future crop yields. The reduced tillage 2 practices showed the highest responses of erosion control to climate change followed by the reduced tillage 1 and conventional tillage in this study.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3acrop yield 3aemissions 3aerosion control 3ano-tillage 3arain 3areduced tillage 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asoybeans 3astream flow 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aMississippi 0aClimate change 0aModeling 0aTillage practices 0aStream flow 0aCrop yield1 aJayakody, P.eauthoruDepartment of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Mississippi State University, USA1 aSassenrath, G.F.eauthoruKansas State University, USA1 aOuyang, Y.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, USA0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Apr., v. 168 p.112-124dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0053Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5262824  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774c168e112  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:1446  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6052628249ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00066-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S0378377416300427.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aUSDA/FSUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1873-2283  aMissing ISSN  aagid:5262824  a2019-04-03  a2022-09-0204656nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003400098035002800132040001800160100004800178245012900226520212200355592002802477593001802505650002602523650001302549650001902562650002002581650002002601650001202621650001402633650001102647650001202658650002402670650002202694650001102716650002302727650000902750650001102759650001602770650001002786650001402796650001002810650001102820700016202831700004002993700002603033700003603059700003603095700003203131700003803163773012303201787003303324787001803357787001903375856008103394912001203475914003603487914001303523916001603536917001103552918006703563935002203630949001503652952001903667953006003686954006403746955004103810961001203851974001703863983001503880984001503895991621332400742620221117193109.0220922e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079406842DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120922012doi  aagid:7940684-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro de Carvalho, Miguel Â.

These scenarios anticipate an average temperature rise of 1.4 to 3.7 °C and a decrease in precipitation by 30 to 40%. Consequently, Madeira’s agriculture will suffer the impacts of climate change. To understand these impacts, a baseline of major agrosystem components needs to be established, with the ultimate goal to monitor its consequences in its functioning. CASBio project used the 1961–1991 and 2010–2020 meteorological data series to modulate climate conditions and characterize and monitor six agrosystems for 2 years. One of them was a vineyard, Quinta das Vinhas, representing a typical agrosystem in the Mediterranean climate. The annual and seasonal variation in climatic parameters, soil conditions, microbiological communities, floristic and insect diversity, and crop production was assessed, using a total of 50 parameters. The results were used to establish a baseline of the agrosystem components and their seasonal and annual variation. The major findings are: (i) winter and summer extreme events show a trend in temperature and precipitation supporting a fast change in climate; (ii) a critical imbalance between nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying bacteria was identified, especially in summer, that could be determined by the rise in temperature and drought; (iii) among floristic diversity, the therophytes and geophytes confirm to be the most suitable indicators for the rise in temperature and reduction in precipitation in the agrosystems; (iv) an imbalance in favor of C. capitata plague was observed, associated with the summer rise in temperature and decrease in precipitation; (v) despite an increase in most of the grape varieties production, the Madeiran wine local varieties were shown to be less stable in productivity under observed climate conditions. The agrosystem baseline is a starting point for long-term monitoring and allows for further quantifying the influence of climate change on agrosystem productivity, resilience, and sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aMediterranean climate 3aagronomy 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3adenitrification 3adrought 3ageophytes 3agrapes 3ainsects 3ameteorological data 3anitrogen fixation 3aplague 3aseasonal variation 3asoil 3asummer 3atemperature 3avines 3avineyards 3awines 3awinter1 aRagonezi, Carla eauthoruISOPlexis Centre Sustainable Agriculture and Food Technology, University of Madeira, Campus da Penteada, 9020-105 Funchal, Portugal1 aOliveira, Maria Cristina O.eauthor1 aReis, Fábio eauthor1 aMacedo, Fabrício Lopeseauthor1 ade Freitas, José G.

Reliable climate data can be costly, and currently requires intensive data validation; hence the study aimed to find an alternative resource to quantify the climate over the spatial extent of the Western Cape, for possible semi-real time applications. This study focused on integrating climate and thermal satellite remote sensing data to assess the reaction of the grapevine to a changing environment. Sites were selected over a geographical climatic band; multiple factor analysis was used to evaluate the interaction of weather, specifically temperature, relative humidity and wind speed with grapevine phenology. The aims of the study were to quantify climate change and seasonal variability in the Western Cape with the best station network possible within the limits of the spatial and temporal resolution availability. The satellite land surface temperature and weather station data exhibited a significant linear relationship with a good prediction accuracy. Simple statistical models where employed, with robust resampling techniques achieving a high accuracy in the complex terrain of the Western Cape. Land surface temperature maps are intrinsically spatialised, providing daily temperature values that in the past would have only been possible by spatial interpolation of sparse weather station networks, which could only be as accurate as the input data. This study has provided insights into grapevine and environmental interactions being driven by seasonal variability within the climate shifts in the Western Cape. Grapevine responses such as flowering date were driven most prominently by climate, specifically the summer months of the previous harvest, emphasising the need and the potential use of thermal satellite products to supplement weather station networks.  aPubAg article  dKeyed article  a808balice.allenc2021-10-14damanda.xue2021-10-15 3aVitis 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afactor analysis 3alandscapes 3ameteorological data 3aphenology 3aprediction 3arelative humidity 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3awind speed 3aSouth Africa1 aStrever, A.

Previous studies suggest a greater risk of wind erosion on arid and semi-arid lands due to loss of biomass under a future warmer climate. There have been no studies conducted to assess the impact of climate change on wind erosion in the Columbia Plateau of the Pacific Northwest United States where wind erosion of agricultural lands can cause exceedance of national air quality standards. The Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) was used to assess wind erosion and PM10 (particulate matter ≤10µm in aerodynamic diameter) emissions under a future climate projected by downscaling 18 Global Climate Models (GCM) for a conservative emissions pathway. Wind erosion simulations were conducted at Lacrosse and Lind, WA and Moro, OR on a winter wheat-summer fallow (WW-SF) rotation and at Lind on an additional winter wheat-camelina-summer fallow (WW-Cam-SF) rotation. Each rotation was subject to conservation or conventional tillage practices for a baseline (1970–1999) and mid-21st century climate (2035–2064). A significant increase in temperature and nominal increases in precipitation were projected by an ensemble of climate models for the Columbia Plateau by the mid-21st century. Soil and PM10 losses were 25–84% lower for a mid-21st century climate, due in part to greater biomass production associated with CO2 fertilization and warmer temperatures. The reduction in soil and PM10 loss is projected to be more apparent for conservation tillage practices in the future. Soil and PM10 losses were greater from a WW-Cam-SF rotation than WW-SF rotation when conservation tillage practices were employed during the fallow phase of the rotations. Despite accounting for differences in the length of each rotation, annual soil and PM10 losses remained higher for the WW-Cam-SF rotation than the WW-SF rotation. Soil and PM10 losses were more variable across years during 1970–1999 than 2035–2064; however, small and inconsistent differences in the coefficient of variation in soil loss between 1970–1999 and 2035–2064 suggest similarity in climate extremes which govern wind erosion.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aagricultural land 3aair quality 3aarid lands 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aconservation tillage 3aconventional tillage 3aemissions 3afallow 3aparticulates 3aplateaus 3aprediction 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil quality 3atemperature 3aweather 3awind erosion 3awinter 3aOregon 3aWashington (state) 0aAir quality 0aClimate change 0aPM10 0aSoil conservation 0aWheat 0aWind erosion1 aTatarko, J.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, 2150 Centre Ave., Ft.

An assessment from winter wheat cropland in the Southern Great Plains of the United States  ap. 32-39.  aWith the need to increase crop production to meet the needs of a growing population, protecting the productivity of our soil resource is essential. However, conservationists are concerned that conservation practices that were effective in the past may no longer be effective in the future under projected climate change. In winter wheat cropland in the Southern Great Plains of the U.S., increased precipitation intensity and increased aridity associated with warmer temperatures may pose increased risks of soil erosion from vulnerable soils and landscapes. This investigation was undertaken to determine which conservation practices would be necessary and sufficient to hold annual soil erosion by water under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario at or below the present soil erosion levels. Advances in and benefits of agricultural soil and water conservation over the last century in the United States are briefly reviewed, and challenges and climate uncertainties confronting resource conservation in this century are addressed. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) computer model was used to estimate future soil erosion by water from winter wheat cropland in Central Oklahoma and for 10 projected climates and 7 alternative conservation practices. A comparison with soil erosion values under current climate conditions and conventional tillage operations showed that, on average, a switch from conventional to conservation tillage would be sufficient to offset the average increase in soil erosion by water under most projected climates. More effective conservation practices, such as conservation tillage with a summer cover crop would be required to control soil erosion associated with the most severe climate projections. It was concluded that a broad range of conservation tools are available to agriculture to offset projected future increases in soil erosion by water even under assumed worst case climate change scenarios in Central Oklahoma. The problem is not one of a lack of effective conservation tools, but one of adoption and implementation. Increasing the implementation of today’s conservation programs to address current soil erosion problems associated with the large year-to-year climate variability in the Southern Great Plains would greatly contribute towards mitigation of projected future increases in soil erosion due to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aTriticum aestivum 3aWater Erosion Prediction Project 3aagricultural soils 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acomputer simulation 3aconservation practices 3aconservation programs 3aconservation tillage 3aconventional tillage 3acover crops 3acrop production 3acropland 3adry environmental conditions 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alandscapes 3arisk 3asoil erosion 3asummer 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awater conservation 3awinter wheat 3aGreat Plains region 3aOklahoma 0aSoil erosion 0aConservation 0aClimate change 0aClimate projection 0aSoil productivity 0aTillage1 aNearing, Mark A.eauthoruResearch Agricultural Engineer, USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Southwest Watershed Research, Tucson, AZ, United States1 aSteiner, Jean L.eauthoruSupervisory Soil Scientist/Laboratory Director, USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Grazinglands Research Laboratory, El Reno, OK, United States1 aZhang, Xunchang J.eauthoruResearch Hydrologist, USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Grazinglands Research Laboratory, El Reno, OK, United States1 aNichols, Mary H.eauthoruResearch Hydraulic Engineer, USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Southwest Watershed Research, Tucson, AZ, United States0 tWeather and Climate Extremes.g2015 Dec., v. 10 p.32-39dElsevier B.V.x2212-09477nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2333140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wace.2015.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:23331b2212-0947c10e32  fWeather and Climate Extremes  aBatch:1991  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6054761329ExL  a2018-06-20  aconsyn99-2-00056-HEAD-ONLY.ZIP  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:1991 reviewed on 2018-06-20T04:00:03Z  aagid:5476132  a2016-10-27  a2018-06-2004956nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098024003500136024004200171035002800213040001800241100012400259245011300383300001400496506007600510506003100586520203500617592002802652593001802680596008302698506003702781650002502818650001202843650001902855650000902874650002002883650001202903650003002915650001102945650000902956650002002965650001202985650001602997651002103013651001803034653002403052653001803076653002303094653001703117653001203134653002003146700011603166700012903282700013603411773009803547787003303645787001803678787001903696856008203715856004503797912001203842914003803854914002803892916001503920917001103935918003603946935002203982949001504004953003504019961000904054962004704063962001704110974001704127983001504144984001504159991621678870742620221215142358.0161027s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054761702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crm.2014.08.0012chorus7 a10.1016/j.crm.2014.08.0012doi7 a10.1016/j.crm.2014.08.0012chorusOpen  aagid:5476170-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemos, Maria CarmeneauthoruUniversity of Michigan, 2504 Dana, 440 Church St., Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1041, United States10aCrop advisors as climate information brokers: Building the capacity of US farmers to adapt to climate change  ap. 32-42.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThis paper examines the role of crop advisors as brokers of climate information to support US corn farmers to adapt to climatic change. It uses quantitative data collected from a broad survey of crop advisors in the US Corn Belt to examine the factors that shape advisors’ use of (and willingness to provide) climate information to their clients. Building upon a general model of climate information usability we argue that advisors’ willingness to provide climate advice to farmers is influenced by three main factors: their information seeking habits and behavior, their experience with innovation in the past, and how climate information interplays with other kinds of information that they provide—especially agronomic advice. We find that advisors’ willingness to provide climate related information depends both on factors at the individual and organizational level and on the type of advice they provide. First, at the individual and organizational levels, advisors who work in supportive organizations and who collaborate with other advisors are more likely to provide climate information. Second, advisors are more likely to provide climate information if it does not interfere with their main profit making business (e.g. provision of agronomic advice). Third, there is a significant positive relationship between trust in a greater number or sources of information and use of climate information. Fourth, the way advisors perceive short- and long-term risk also influences their willingness to provide climate information; the more concerned they are about long-term climate-related risks to farming, the more likely they are to provide (or want to provide) advice based on climate information. Differently from other empirical work in the literature, our analytical model suggests that neither negative experiences with climate information in the past nor the high level of uncertainty characteristic of climate information appear to influence advisors willingness to provide climate information in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abusiness enterprises 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3adata collection 3afarmers 3ainformation dissemination 3amodels 3arisk 3arisk management 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3aCorn Belt region 3aUnited States 0aClimate information 0aCrop advisors 0aClimate adaptation 0aUS Corn Belt 0aFarmers 0aInformation use1 aLo, Yun-JiaeauthoruUniversity of Michigan, 2504 Dana, 440 Church St., Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1041, United States1 aKirchhoff, ChristineeauthoruUniversity of Connecticut, 261 Glenbrook Road, Unit 3037, Storrs, CT 06269-3037, United States1 aHaigh, TonyaeauthoruUniversity of Nebraska, Lincoln, 810 Hardin Hall, 3310 Holdrege Street, Lincoln, NE 68583-0988, United States0 tClimate risk management.g2014, v. 4-5 p.32-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23250x2212-09637nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2325040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2014.08.0013Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5476170  aArticle  aJournal:23250b2212-0963c4-5e32  fClimate risk management  aBatch:1722  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6054761709ExL  a2020-03-06  aconsyn99-2-00056-HEAD-ONLY.ZIP  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 2212-0963  aMissing ISSN  aagid:5476170  a2016-10-27  a2022-09-0604022nab a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002100097035002600118040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180100002500189245008300214300001600297500002400313520206500337593001802402593002002420650001702440650002902457650002202486650002402508650001902532650002302551650001902574650002702593650002502620653002302645773009302668787001802761787003302779787003002812787002402842852000902866856011202875912001202987914004502999914003903044917001103083930003303094935002103127945002503148946001103173949001503184952005103199961001303250974001503263984001503278985010303293986001203396991621707080742620221121104909.0100921e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444270422DNAL7 a10113/492412hdl  aagid:49241-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF300 0aP1201 aJaradat, Abdullah A.10aGenetic resources of energy crops: Biological systems to combat climate change  ap. 309-323.  aIncludes references  aBioenergy crop plants that function as solar energy collectors and thermo-chemical energy storage systems are the basis for biological systems that are expected to contribute to renewable energy production, help stabilize the rising levels of green house gases (GHG), and mitigate the risk of global climate change (GCC). Wide genetic resource bases, especially of wild and semidomesticated perennial grasses and woody species of starch-, oil, and lingocellulose-producing plants, are available to select, breed, genetically-modify, and develop environmentally-friendly bioenergy crops. Plant species, with fast growth, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and low requirements for biological, chemical or physical pretreatments, are being evaluated as potential bioenergy crops. Currently, bioenergy systems based on traditional sources and first generation bioenergy crops, are not sustainable and their exploitation may contribute to environmental degradation. New genetic resources and technological breakthroughs are being employed to develop dedicated bioenergy crops (DECs) with better GHG profiles and with a suite of eco-physiological traits to maximize radiation interception, water- (WUE) and nutrient-use efficiencies (NUE), improved lingocellulosic accessibility to enzymatic degradation, and to confer environmental sustainability. Large-scale bioenergy crop plantations pose both opportunities and challenges, and will inevitably compete with food crops for land, water, nutrient resources and other inputs; whereas, biodiversity consequences of increased biofuel production will most likely result in habitat loss, increased and enhanced dispersion of invasive species, and pollution. Recent genetic modifications and breeding efforts of bioenergy crops aim at improving biomass yield, quality, and conversion efficiency. Improvements in composition and structure of bio-chemicals in bioenergy crops will enable the production of more energy per ton of biomass and will improve its caloric value, GHG profile, and GCC mitigation potential.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aenergy crops 3arenewable energy sources 3agenetic resources 3agenetic improvement 3aclimate change 3abiomass production 3aplant breeding 3agenetic transformation 3aenvironmental impact 0aliterature reviews0 tAustralian journal of crop science.g2010 July, v.  4, no.  5 p.309-323x1835-27077nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl4247226  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/492413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4247226b1835-2707c4d5e309  fAustralian journal of crop science  aissued  a20110714b20110805c00000000  aIND444270429ExL  aINDdRSCe2011/07/14  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20110714 20110805 00000000bIND RSC 2011/07/14  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:49241  a2012-06-07  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a442704204939nab a2200901 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002100097024003000118035002600148040001800174100014500192245005800337300001400395520095600409592002801365593001801393593002001411650001901431650001801450650002701468650001601495650002501511650002301536650002401559650002001583650003001603650001301633650002201646650001701668650000901685650001501694650001901709650001501728650002101743650001901764650001801783650002201801650001901823650002701842651001801869653001901887653001001906653001501916653001501931653001901946700019501965700015302160700016002313700018502473700012302658700011102781700015802892700015803050773013203208787001803340787003303358787003003391787002403421856007703445856011203522912001203634914004403646914002803690917001103718918005103729935002103780949001503801953006203816954005503878955003403933961001303967974001503980983001503995984001504010986001204025991621707610742620221121104912.0200226e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445727192DNAL7 a10113/493002hdl7 a10.3920/WMJ2010.12462doi  aagid:49300-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, F.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, 100 Technology Dr., Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA10aClimate change impacts on mycotoxin risks in US maize  ap. 79-93.  aTo ensure future food security, it is crucial to understand how potential climate change scenarios will affect agriculture. One key area of interest is how climatic factors, both in the near- and the long-term future, could affect fungal infection of crops and mycotoxin production by these fungi. The objective of this paper is to review the potential impact of climate change on three important mycotoxins that contaminate maize in the United States, and to highlight key research questions and approaches for understanding this impact. Recent climate change analyses that pertain to agriculture and in particular to mycotoxigenic fungi are discussed, with respect to the climatic factors – temperature and relative humidity – at which they thrive and cause severe damage. Additionally, we discuss how climate change will likely alter the life cycles and geographic distribution of insects that are known to facilitate fungal infection of crops.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3ainsect vectors 3afood security 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aagriculture 3apostharvest diseases 3apostharvest losses 3aambient temperature 3aeconomic impact 3ageographical distribution 3aZea mays 3arelative humidity 3arisk factors 3acorn 3aaflatoxins 3aclimate change 3afumonisins 3aclimatic factors 3adeoxynivalenol 3amolds (fungi) 3atoxigenic strains 3afood pathogens 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aUnited States 0aclimate change 0amaize 0aaflatoxins 0afumonisins 0adeoxynivalenol1 aBhatnagar, D.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Southern Regional Research Center, 1100 Robert E.

This paper synthesizes the collection of research on the future of agricultural production in the Southwestern United States. A variety of assessment methods indicate the diverse impacts and risks across the Southwest, often related to water availability, which drives adaptive measures in this region. Sector- or species-specific adaptive measures have long been practiced in this region and will continue to be necessary to support agricultural production as a regional enterprise. Diversification of crop selection and income source imparts climate resilience. Building upon biophysical vulnerability through incorporating social and economic factors is critical to future adaptation planning efforts. The persistence and adaptive capacity of agriculture in the water-limited Southwest serves as an instructive example for producers outside the region expecting drier and warmer conditions and may offer solutions to reduce future climate impacts.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abusiness enterprises 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acosts and returns 3aeconomic factors 3aforests 3aincome 3alandowners 3alandscapes 3alivelihood 3aplanning 3aranchers 3arisk 3aviability 3aSouthwestern United States1 aReyes, JulianeauthoruUSDA—Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental Range, Southwest Climate Hub, Las Cruces, NM, USA1 aSteele, CaitieauthoruNew Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA1 aRango, AlberteauthoruUSDA—Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental Range, Southwest Climate Hub, Las Cruces, NM, USA0 tClimatic change.g2018 June, v. 148, no. 3 p.339-353dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-018-2219-x3Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c148d3e339  fClimatic change  aBatch:2013  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6059655149ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-06-07_05-53-47.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-148-3.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:2013 reviewed on 2018-07-16T04:00:02Z  aagid:5965514  a2018-06-19  a2020-03-0603973nab a2200649 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100014400179245008000323300001600403520145300419592002801872593001801900650001901918650001301937650001201950650001601962650002201978650001302000650002202013650002902035650002002064650001902084650001802103650001602121650002002137651003102157700011102188700011002299700010002409700011102509773011302620787003302733787001802766787002102784856008102805912001202886914004402898914002002942916001502962917001102977918002902988935002203017949001503039953006703054954005703121955003703178961001303215962004803228974001703276983001503293984001503308991622459400742620221117223414.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059655152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-018-2220-42doi  aagid:5965515-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteele, CaitrianaeauthoruDepartment of Plant and Environmental Sciences, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA. caiti@nmsu.edu10aCascading impacts of climate change on southwestern US cropland agriculture  ap. 437-450.  aThe interior southwest United States is one of the hottest, driest regions on the planet, yet irrigated cropland agriculture is successfully practiced where there is access to surface water and/or groundwater. Through climate change, the southwest is projected to become even hotter and drier, increasing the challenges faced by farmers across the region. We can assess the vulnerability of cropland agriculture, to assist in developing potential solutions to these challenges of warming temperatures and water scarcity. However, these types of biophysical vulnerability assessment usually generate technological or policy-level solutions that do not necessarily account for farmers’ ability to respond to climate change impacts. Further, there are non-climatic factors that also threaten the future of agriculture in the region, such as population increase, loss of agricultural land, and increasing competition for depleting water resources. In this paper, we assert that to fully address how southwestern farmers may respond to climate change impacts, we must consider both biophysical outcome and contextual vulnerabilities. Future research on individual localities and/or specific commodities and including cross-disciplinary analysis of socio-economic, institutional, cultural, and political factors alongside biophysical factors will help to develop more substantive understanding of system vulnerabilities and feasible adaptive solutions.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3acropland 3afarmers 3agroundwater 3airrigated farming 3apolitics 3apopulation growth 3aproducts and commodities 3arisk assessment 3asocioeconomics 3asurface water 3atemperature 3awater shortages 3aSouthwestern United States1 aReyes, JulianeauthoruUSDA-Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM, USA1 aElias, EmileeauthoruUSDA-Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM, USA1 aAney, SierraeauthoruDepartment of Geography, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA1 aRango, AlberteauthoruUSDA-Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM, USA0 tClimatic change.g2018 June, v. 148, no. 3 p.437-450dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-018-2220-43Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c148d3e437  fClimatic change  aBatch:2013  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6059655159ExL  a2018-07-16  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-06-07_05-53-47.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-148-3.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:2013 reviewed on 2018-07-16T04:00:02Z  aagid:5965515  a2018-06-19  a2018-07-1605362nab a2200829 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098024003500136024004200171035002800213040001800241100016400259245008800423300001600511506002800527506006400555520193200619592002802551593001802579596004402597596004502641506003702686650000902723650001202732650003002744650001202774650001902786650001602805650002002821650001202841650002402853650001102877650001202888650002002900650001502920650001302935650001302948650001702961650001102978650001602989651003103005700014303036700010103179700013903280700012703419700012203546700013903668773011303807787003303920787001803953787002103971856008103992903002204073912001204095914004404107914002004151916001504171917001104186918002904197935002204226949001504248953006704263954005704330955003704387961001304424962004804437974001704485983001504502984001504517991622459570742620221207101205.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059655122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-017-2040-y2chorus7 a10.1007/s10584-017-2040-y2doi7 a10.1007/s10584-017-2040-y2chorusOpen  aagid:5965512-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElias, EmileeauthoruU.S. Department of Agriculture–Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM, USA. emile.elias@ARS.USDA.GOV10aCounty-level climate change information to support decision-making on working lands  ap. 355-369.  aResource is Open Access  aSpringer Science and Business Media LLC License Information  aFarmers, ranchers, and forest landowners across the USA make weather- and climate-related management decisions at varying temporal and spatial scales, often with input from local experts like crop consultants and cooperative extension (CE) personnel. In order to provide additional guidance to such longer-term planning efforts, we developed a tool that shows statistically downscaled climate projections of temperature and precipitation consolidated to the county level for the contiguous US. Using the county as a fundamental mapping unit encourages the use of this information within existing institutional structures like CE and other U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs. A “quick-look” metric based on the spatial variability of climate within each county aids in the interpretation of county-level information. For instance, relatively higher spatial variability within a county indicates that more localized information should be used to support stakeholder planning. Changes in annual precipitation show a latitudinal dipole where increases are projected for much of the northern US while declines are projected for counties across the southern US. Seasonal shifts in county-level precipitation are projected nationwide with declines most evident in summer months in most regions. Changes in the spatial variability of annual precipitation for most counties were less than 10 mm, indicating fairly spatially homogenous midcentury precipitation changes at the county level. Annual and seasonal midcentury temperatures are projected to increase across the USA, with relatively low change in the spatial variability (<0.3 °C) of temperature across most counties. The utility of these data is shown for forage and almond applications, both indicating a potential decline in production in some future years, to illustrate use of county-level seasonal projections in adaptation planning and decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUSDA 3aalmonds 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconsultants 3adecision making 3aexperts 3aextension education 3aforage 3aforests 3ahuman resources 3alandowners 3aplanning 3aranchers 3astakeholders 3asummer 3atemperature 3aSoutheastern United States1 aSchrader, T.ScotteauthoruU.S. Department of Agriculture–Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM, USA1 aAbatzoglou, JohnT.eauthoruDepartment of Geography, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, 83844, USA1 aJames, DarreneauthoruU.S. Department of Agriculture–Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM, USA1 aCrimmins, MikeeauthoruDepartment of Soil, Water and Environmental Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, USA1 aWeiss, JeremyeauthoruSchool of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, USA1 aRango, AlberteauthoruU.S. Department of Agriculture–Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM, USA0 tClimatic change.g2018 June, v. 148, no. 3 p.355-369dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-2040-y3Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c148d3e355  fClimatic change  aBatch:2013  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6059655129ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-06-07_05-53-47.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-148-3.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:2013 reviewed on 2018-07-16T04:00:02Z  aagid:5965512  a2018-06-19  a2020-03-0603570nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100016700171245011500338300001600453520131800469592002801787593001801815650003101833650002401864650001901888650002501907650000901932650001401941650002001955650002101975650001901996650001702015650001702032650001502049650001302064651002302077700003102100700003302131773013602164787003302300787001802333787001802351856007302369912001202442914003902454914001902493916001502512917001102527918006702538935002202605949001502627953007502642954007902717955004102796961001202837962004802849974001702897983001502914984001502929991622484340742620221117223649.0190713e20130108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065298392DNAL7 a10.3390/su50101362doi  aagid:6529839-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaymond, Crystal L.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 400 North 34th Street, Suite 201, Seattle, WA 98103, USA. craymond@fs.fed.us14aThe North Cascadia Adaptation Partnership: A Science-Management Collaboration for Responding to Climate Change  ap. 136-159.  aThe U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and National Park Service (NPS) have highlighted climate change as an agency priority and issued direction to administrative units for responding to climate change. In response, the USFS and NPS initiated the North Cascadia Adaptation Partnership (NCAP) in 2010. The goals of the NCAP were to build an inclusive partnership, increase climate change awareness, assess vulnerability, and develop science-based adaptation strategies to reduce these vulnerabilities. The NCAP expanded previous science-management partnerships on federal lands to a larger, more ecologically and geographically complex region and extended the approach to a broader range of stakeholders. The NCAP focused on two national forests and two national parks in the North Cascades Range, Washington (USA), a total land area of 2.4 million ha, making it the largest science-management partnership of its kind. The NCAP assessed climate change vulnerability for four resource sectors (hydrology and access; vegetation and ecological disturbance; wildlife; and fish) and developed adaptation options for each sector. The NCAP process has proven to be a successful approach for implementing climate change adaptation across a region and can be emulated by other land management agencies in North America and beyond.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aU.S. National Park Service 3aUSDA Forest Service 3aclimate change 3aecological imbalance 3afish 3ahydrology 3aland management 3anational forests 3anational parks 3apublic lands 3astakeholders 3avegetation 3awildlife 3aWashington (state)1 aPeterson, David L.eauthor1 aRochefort, Regina M.eauthor0 tSustainability.g2013 Jan. 08, v. 5, no. 1 p.136-159dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)227040uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su50101363Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:2270b2071-1050c5d1e136  fSustainability  aBatch:2410  aissued2 aMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing Instituteeprovider5DNAL  aIND6065298399ExL  a2020-02-19  a/data/metadata/incoming/mdpinstitute/sustainability-v5-i1_20130124.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/sustainability-v5-i1_20130124.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2410 reviewed on 2020-02-19T14:00:02Z  aagid:6529839  a2019-07-13  a2020-02-1905397nab a2200877 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097035002700132040001800159100010700177245007800284300001600362500001500378520250800393592002802901593001802929650001802947650000902965650001002974650001802984650001903002650002203021650001903043650002003062650001903082650002503101650002903126650002203155650001203177650002703189650002003216650001403236650000903250650001703259650002903276650001703305650001603322650001803338650001503356650001603371650001103387650001203398650001303410650002003423650001603443650001003459651001803469651001103487653000903498653001503507700014803522700010703670700010503777773009703882787003303979787001804012787002204030856008104052912001204133914003404145914002504179917001104204918003404215935002104249949001504270953003304285961001304318962004804331962004704379962004704426974001604473983001504489984001504504991623131020742620221118014202.0141110e20111220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446762832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2011.07.0012doi  aagid:451167-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Jeffrey W.eauthoruALARC, USDA-ARS, 21881 North Cardon Lane, Maricopa, AZ 85138, United States10aMethodologies for simulating impacts of climate change on crop production  ap. 357-368.  a2019-12-06  aEcophysiological models are widely used to forecast potential impacts of climate change on future agricultural productivity and to examine options for adaptation by local stakeholders and policy makers. However, protocols followed in such assessments vary to such an extent that they constrain cross-study syntheses and increase the potential for bias in projected impacts. We reviewed 221 peer-reviewed papers that used crop simulation models to examine diverse aspects of how climate change might affect agricultural systems. Six subject areas were examined: target crops and regions; the crop model(s) used and their characteristics; sources and application of data on [COâ] and climate; impact parameters evaluated; assessment of variability or risk; and adaptation strategies. Wheat, maize, soybean and rice were considered in approximately 170 papers. The USA (55 papers) and Europe (64 papers) were the dominant regions studied. The most frequent approach used to simulate response to COâ involved adjusting daily radiation use efficiency (RUE) and transpiration, precluding consideration of the interacting effects of COâ, stomatal conductance and canopy temperature, which are expected to exacerbate effects of global warming. The assumed baseline [COâ] typically corresponded to conditions 10â30 years earlier than the date the paper was accepted, exaggerating the relative impacts of increased [COâ]. Due in part to the diverse scenarios for increases in greenhouse gas emissions, assumed future [COâ] also varied greatly, further complicating comparisons among studies. Papers considering adaptation predominantly examined changes in planting dates and cultivars; only 20 papers tested different tillage practices or crop rotations. Risk was quantified in over half the papers, mainly in relation to variability in yield or effects of water deficits, but the limited consideration of other factors affecting risk beside climate change per se suggests that impacts of climate change were overestimated relative to background variability. A coordinated crop, climate and soil data resource would allow researchers to focus on underlying science. More extensive model intercomparison, facilitated by modular software, should strengthen the biological realism of predictions and clarify the limits of our ability to forecast agricultural impacts of climate change on crop production and associated food security as well as to evaluate potential for adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aplanting date 3arice 3awheat 3afood security 3aglobal warming 3acomputer software 3asoil resources 3aRuta graveolens 3acarbon dioxide 3astomatal conductance 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3aclimate 3aagricultural forecasts 3acrop production 3acultivars 3acorn 3arisk factors 3aradiation use efficiency 3astakeholders 3atemperature 3acrop rotation 3aprediction 3acrop models 3acanopy 3atillage 3asoybeans 3afood production 3aresearchers 3acrops 3aUnited States 3aEurope 0arisk 0aadaptation1 aHoogenboom, GerriteauthoruDepartment of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, University of Georgia, Griffin, GA 30223-1797, United States1 aKimball, Bruce A.eauthoruALARC, USDA-ARS, 21881 North Cardon Lane, Maricopa, AZ 85138, United States1 aWall, Gerard W.eauthoruALARC, USDA-ARS, 21881 North Cardon Lane, Maricopa, AZ 85138, United States0 tField crops research.g2011 Dec. 20, v. 124, no. 3 p.357-368dElsevier B.V.x0378-42907nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl1021540uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2011.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl10215c124d3e357  fField crops research  aissued2 aElsevier B.V.eprovider5DNAL  aIND446762839ExL  a2013-04-29  aNAL269800378429001240003.xml  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:196 annotated on 2013-04-22T09:54:21Z  aBatch:196 reviewed on 2013-04-29T12:00:02Z  aBatch:196 reviewed on 2013-04-29T13:00:02Z  aagid:451167  a2014-11-10  a2014-11-1004622nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003600097024002100133035002600154040001800180072000900198072000900207100012100216245011700337300001400454500001500468520156600483592002802049593001802077650001902095650002102114650001602135650001902151650002202170650001302192650001302205651001302218651001802231653001802249653003202267653001002299653001102309653001502320700011802335700010302453700008502556700010602641700011002747700010402857700010402961773009903065787001803164787003003182787003303212852000903245856011203254856008603366912001203452914003603464917001103500918002703511930003303538935002103571945002503592949001503617952005103632953003603683961001203719974001503731984001503746985010303761986001203864991623167330742620221118014232.0110623e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445924842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2009.12.0012doi7 a10113/497752hdl  aagid:49775-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aX3301 aHellmann, Jessica J.eauthoruDepartment of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA10aClimate Change Impacts on Terrestrial Ecosystems in Metropolitan Chicago and Its Surrounding, Multi-State Region  ap. 74-85.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper describes the potential impacts of warming temperatures and changing precipitation on plants, wildlife, invasive species, pests, and agricultural ecosystems across the multi-state region centered on Chicago, Illinois. We examine a geographic area that captures much of Lake Michigan, including a complex mosaic of urbanization and agriculture surrounding southern Lake Michigan. We consider species currently present within this broad region as well as species that are expected to move into or out of the area as climate zones shift northward through the coming century. Our analysis draws upon disparate data sources to compile projections. We conclude that a complex mixture of land use poses particular challenges to natural ecosystems in this region under climate change. Dispersal is likely to be limited for some species, and some populations of native taxa may already be reduced due to habitat loss. Other species can persist, even thrive, within a mixed landscape mosaic, provided natural areas and green spaces are available. If such spaces are somehow connected, they can provide opportunities for native species to inhabit and move through the metropolitan region (perhaps even better than the landscapes previously dominated by agriculture). Strategies for adapting regional agriculture and minimizing pest outbreaks also call for creative management intervention. With additional research, Chicago and its surrounding environs have an opportunity to provide leadership on effective management of natural resources under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aagroecosystems 3ainvasive species 3aurban areas 3aclimate change 3awildlife habitats 3aland use 3awildlife 3aIllinois 3aLake Michigan 0aprecipitation 0anatural resource management 0apests 0aplants 0aecosystems1 aNadelhoffer, Knute J.eauthoruEcology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA1 aIverson, Louis R.eauthoruNorthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Delaware, OH 43015, USA1 aZiska, Lewis H.eauthoruUS Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, MD 20705, USA1 aMatthews, Stephen N.eauthoruNorthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Delaware, OH 43015, USA1 aMyers, PhilipeauthoruEcology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA1 aPrasad, Anantha M.eauthoruNorthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Delaware, OH 43015, USA1 aPeters, Matthew P.eauthoruNorthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Delaware, OH 43015, USA0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2010 July, v. 36, no. sp2 p.74-85dElsevierx0380-13307nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/497753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2009.12.0013Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fJournal of Great Lakes research  aissued2 aBioOneeprovider5DNAL  a20110802b20110902c00000000  aIND445924849ExL  aINDdYLPe2011/08/01  a2016-09-13  a20110802 20110902 00000000bIND YLP 2011/08/01  aJGLRv36isp2-04282019-172464.zip  aUSDA/FS  aagid:49775  a2018-05-25  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a459248403171nab a2200637 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002900098035002800127040001800155100009900173245014600272300001600418500002000434520063700454592002801091593001801119596004701137596003101184650001901215650000901234650001501243650002301258650001201281650001101293650000901304650001301313651002101326651001801347700009601365700005601461700009801517700009201615700011001707773014301817787003301960787001801993787002402011856007602035912001202111914004602123914004502169916001502214917001102229918004302240935002202283949001502305953005702320954006102377955003402438961001402472974001702486983001502503984001502518991623222120742620221117222504.0220820e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062114692DNAL7 a10.1093/aepp/ppw0232doi  aagid:6211469-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, WyatteauthoruAgricultural and Applied Economics Department, University of Missouri12aA Cost of Tractability?

Corn and soybean farming dominates this region, but studies typically do not assess the joint impact of new distributions of corn and soybean yields on markets. We use a structural economic model with projections of climate‐driven yield changes to simulate these effects. Our findings suggest that a narrow focus on a single crop in this key growing region risks underestimating the impact on price distributions and average crop receipts, and can lead to incorrect signs on estimated impacts.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  a2012‐68002‐19872cUSDA 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop yield 3aeconometric models 3amarkets 3aprices 3arisk 3asoybeans 3aCorn Belt region 3aUnited States1 aGerlt, ScotteauthoruAgricultural and Applied Economics Department, University of Missouri1 aCampbell, J.

However, few studies have been conducted to quantify sunflower productivity and water productivity (WP) under semi-arid conditions and projected climate change. Experiments were conducted in 2008, 2010, and 2011 on sunflowers under deficit irrigation to meet a fraction of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) as estimated by FAO-56 in eastern Colorado. The field data was used to calibrate and validate the CSM-CROPGRO-Sunflower model that is incorporated in the Root Zone Water Qualify Model (RZWQM2). The calibrated model was then used to simulate sunflower production under projected climate conditions with four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and four irrigation levels (100%, 60%, 40% ETc and rainfed) in the late 21st century. The results showed that the model was able to adequately simulate sunflower biomass, yield, and soil water storage under the different irrigation treatments in all three years. The corresponding relative root mean square deviation (RRMSD) values were between 0.05 and 0.15 for the simulations of soil water storage, yield, and biomass. Under future climate change conditions, the model simulated greater impact of irrigation treatments than RCP scenarios on sunflower production. For example, yield was 3251.3, 2638.85 and 1937.17 kg ha⁻¹ with 100%, 60% and 40% ETc irrigation under baseline (1992–2013) and was 2932.47, 2360.53 and 1810.65 kg ha⁻¹ with these irrigation treatments under RCP8.5 (2070–2091). Simulation results also showed that scheduling irrigations based on 60% of ETc was the best choice for sunflower WP in eastern Colorado. Climate change did not affect sunflower biomass, yield, and WP. There was an increasing trend of irrigation amount was simulated from the baseline to RCP8.5 scenario to maintain a certain percent of ETc due to high temperature projected. For instance, the irrigation amount for 100%, 60% and 40% of ETc irrigation treatment was 16.4%, 17.3%, and 20.0% higher under RCP8.5 than those under baseline conditions with CO₂ fertilization. Finally, our results demonstrated that RZWQM2 can be used to effectively schedule sunflower irrigations based on crop evapotranspiration requirement.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aHelianthus annuus 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3adeficit irrigation 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation rates 3amodels 3arhizosphere 3asoil water storage 3asummer 3atemperature 3awheat 3aColorado 0aRZWQM2 0aCropGro 0aCrop simulation 0aIrrigation management1 aZhang, HuihuieauthoruUSDA-ARS, Water Management and Systems Research Unit, Fort Collins, CO 80526, USA1 aSima, Matthew W.eauthoruDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08544, USA1 aTrout, Thomas J.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Water Management and Systems Research Unit, Fort Collins, CO 80526, USA1 aMalone, Rob W.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, Ames, IA, USA1 aWang, LieauthoruCollege of Natural Resources and Environment, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 246 p.106672-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1066723Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774c246e106672  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:10117  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6072092989ExL  a2021-08-30  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/125396119607361268-00002-HEAD-ONLY-REVISEDSUBJECTLIST.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0378377420322162.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:7209298  a2021-02-01  a2021-08-3003236nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003900097024002100136035002600157040001800183072000900201072000900210072000900219072000900228100001800237245016800255300001600423500002400439520118900463593001801652650001901670650001801689650002401707650002501731650001301756650003001769650001801799650001401817650002101831651001801852700001701870773007001887787001801957787003001975787003302005852000902038856011202047856008902159912001202248914002602260917001102286930003302297935002102330945002502351946001102376949001502387952005102402961001202453974001502465984001502480985010302495986001202598991624074550742620221117224335.0091106e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442809232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2007.11.0022doi7 a10113/361352hdl  aagid:36135-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aB200 0aK250 0aX1001 aWoodall, C.W.10aRelationships between forest fine and coarse woody debris carbon stocks across latitudinal gradients in the United States as an indicator of climate change effects  ap. 686-690.  aIncludes references  aCoarse and fine woody materials (CWD and FWD) are substantial forest ecosystem carbon (C) stocks. There is a lack of understanding how these detritus C stocks may respond to climate change. This study used a nation-wide inventory of CWD and FWD in the United States to examine how these C stocks vary by latitude. Results indicate that the highest CWD and FWD C stocks are found in forests with the highest latitude, while conversely the lowest C stocks are found in the most southerly forests. CWD and FWD respond differently to changes in latitude with CWD C stocks decreasing more rapidly as latitude decreased. If latitude can be broadly assumed to indicate temperature and potential rate of detrital decay, it may be postulated that CWD C stocks may be at the highest risk of becoming a net C source if temperatures increase. The latitude at which CWD and FWD C stocks roughly equal each other (equilibrium point) may serve as an indicator of changes in C stock equilibrium under a global warming scenario. Given the complex relationships between detrital C stocks, biomass production/decay, and climatic variables, further research is suggested to refine this study's indicator.  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3aforest litter 3acoarse woody debris 3acarbon sequestration 3alatitude 3ageographical distribution 3adata analysis 3aequations 3aforest inventory 3aUnited States1 aLiknes, G.C.0 tEcological indicators.g2008 Sept., v.  8, no.  5 p.686-6907nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/361353Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2007.11.0023Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fEcological indicators  aissued  a20091130b20091204c00000000  aIND442809239ExL  aINDdLYNe2009/11/27  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20091130 20091204 00000000bIND LYN 2009/11/27  aUSDA/FS  aagid:36135  a2009-12-04  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a428092304114nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004100097024002100138035002600159040001800185072000900203072000900212072000900221072000900230100001700239245007700256300001400333500002400347500001500371520187000386593001802256650001202274650003002286650001902316650001902335650002202354650002002376650001802396650001902414650001502433650001802448650001702466650002102483650001502504650001502519651001802534653001802552653001402570700001602584700001502600700001602615773007602631787001802707787003002725787003302755852000902788856011202797856009102909912001203000914003203012917001103044930003303055935002103088945002503109946001103134949001503145952005103160961001203211974001503223984001503238985010303253986001203356991624574450742620221118005042.0090319e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441788332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2008.01.0072doi7 a10113/271042hdl  aagid:27104-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX330 0aB200 0aF300 0aK8101 aBachelet, D.10aVEMAP vs VINCERA: A DGVM sensitivity to differences in climate scenarios  ap. 38-48.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe MC1 DGVM has been used in two international model comparison projects, VEMAP (Vegetation Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project) and VINCERA (Vulnerability and Impacts of North American forests to Climate Change: Ecosystem Responses and Adaptation). The latest version of MC1 was run on both VINCERA and VEMAP climate and soil input data to document how a change in the inputs can affect model outcome. We compared simulation results under the two sets of future climate scenarios and reported on how the different inputs can affect vegetation distribution and carbon budget projections. Under all future scenarios, the interior West becomes woodier as warmer temperatures and available moisture allow trees to get established in grasslands areas. Concurrently, warmer and drier weather causes the eastern deciduous and mixed forests to shift to a more open canopy woodland or savanna type while boreal forests disappear almost entirely from the Great Lakes area by the end of the 21st century. While under VEMAP scenarios the model simulated large increases in carbon storage in a future woodier West, the drier VINCERA scenarios accounted for large carbon losses in the east and only moderate gains in the West. But under all future climate scenarios, the total area burned by wildfires increased especially in C4 grasslands under all scenarios and in dry woodlands under VINCERA scenarios. The model simulated non-agricultural lands in the conterminous United States as a source of carbon in the 21st century under the VINCERA future climate scenarios but not VEMAP. However, the magnitude of this carbon source to the atmosphere could be greatly reduced if the CO2 growth enhancement factor built in the model was enhanced but evidence that all mature forests across the entire country will respond positively to increased atmospheric CO2 is still lacking.  aPubAg article 3ahistory 3ageographical distribution 3acarbon dioxide 3adynamic models 3asimulation models 3aair temperature 3athematic maps 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3agas emissions 3aforest fires 3aclimatic factors 3avegetation 3aprediction 3aUnited States 0aprecipitation 0awildfires1 aLenihan, J.1 aDrapek, R.1 aNeilson, R.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2008 Nov., v.  64, no.  1-2 p.38-487nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/271043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2008.01.0073Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fGlobal and planetary change  aissued  a20090323b20090508c00000000  aIND441788339ExL  aINDdGAYe2009/03/23  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20090323 20090508 00000000bIND GAY 2009/03/23  aUSDA/FS  aagid:27104  a2009-05-22  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a417883304543nab a2200769 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004100097024002100138035002600159040001800185072000900203072000900212072000900221072000900230100002200239245016900261300001400430500002400444500001500468520210900483593001802592650001202610650003002622650001902652650002202671650001902693650001502712650001702727650002702744650002002771650002102791650001802812650001902830650001802849650001502867650002102882650001502903650001502918651001802933653001802951700002402969700002302993700002003016773007603036787001803112787003003130787003303160852000903193856011203202856009103314912001203405914003203417917001103449930003303460935002103493945002503514946001103539949001503550952005103565961001203616974001503628984001503643985010303658986001203761991624574670742620221118005143.0090319e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441788322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2008.01.0062doi7 a10113/271072hdl  aagid:27107-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX330 0aB200 0aF300 0aK8101 aLenihan, James M.10aSimulated response of conterminous United States ecosystems to climate change at different levels of fire suppression, CO2 emission rate, and growth response to CO2  ap. 16-25.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA modeling experiment was designed to investigate the impact of fire management, CO2 emission rate, and the growth response to CO2 on the response of ecosystems in the conterminous United States to climate scenarios produced by three different General Circulation Models (GCMs) as simulated by the MC1 Dynamic General Vegetation Model (DGVM). Distinct regional trends in response to projected climatic change were evident across all combinations of the experimental factors. In the eastern half of the U.S., the average response to relatively large increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation was an 11% loss of total ecosystem carbon. In the West, the response to increases in precipitation and relatively small increases in temperature was a 5% increase in total carbon stocks. Simulated fire suppression reduced average carbon losses in the East to about 6%, and preserved forests which were largely converted to woodland and savanna in the absence of fire suppression. Across the west, unsuppressed fire maintained near constant carbon stocks despite increases in vegetation productivity. With fire suppression, western carbon stocks increased by 10% and most shrublands were converted to woodland or even forest. With a relatively high level of growth in response to CO2, total ecosystem carbon pools at the end of the century were on average about 9-10% larger in both regions of the U.S. compared to a low CO2 response. The western U.S. gained enough carbon to counter losses from unsuppressed fire only with the high CO2 response, especially in conjunction with the higher CO2 emission rate. In the eastern U.S., fire suppression was sufficient to produce a simulated carbon sink only with both the high CO2 response and emission rate. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the impacts of global warming on the ecosystems of the conterminous U.S., some of which resides in the future trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions, in the direct response of vegetation to increasing CO2, and in future tradeoffs among different fire management options, as illustrated in this study.  aPubAg article 3ahistory 3ageographical distribution 3acarbon dioxide 3asimulation models 3adynamic models 3aecoregions 3afire ecology 3ageographical variation 3aair temperature 3afire suppression 3athematic maps 3aclimate change 3agas emissions 3aecosystems 3aclimatic factors 3avegetation 3aprediction 3aUnited States 0aprecipitation1 aBachelet, Dominique1 aNeilson, Ronald P.1 aDrapek, Raymond0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2008 Nov., v.  64, no.  1-2 p.16-257nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/271073Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2008.01.0063Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fGlobal and planetary change  aissued  a20090323b20090508c00000000  aIND441788329ExL  aINDdGAYe2009/03/23  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20090323 20090508 00000000bIND GAY 2009/03/23  aUSDA/FS  aagid:27107  a2009-05-22  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a417883205027nab a2201033 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003300097024002100130024001900151024002100170035002600191040001800217072000900235072000900244072000900253072000900262072000900271100002200280245006600302300002000368500002400388500001500412506007600427520176900503593001802272593002002290506003702310650002102347650001802368650001602386650001302402650001102415650002002426650001902446650002402465650001102489650001902500650002502519650001102544650001802555650001802573650001402591651001502605653002702620653001902647700001802666700002602684700002302710700002102733700002202754700002202776700002602798700003002824700002102854700001602875700001602891700002502907700002702932700001902959700002102978700002302999700002303022700002303045773014803068787001803216787003303234787003003267787002203297852000903319856011203328856008303440912001203523914004803535914008403583917001103667930003303678935002103711945002503732946001303757949001503770952005103785961001203836974001503848984001503863985010303878986001203981991624575020742620221207124930.0090318e20040824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441786802DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.04045001012doi7 aPMC5146532pmcid7 a153142272pmid7 a10113/271102hdl  aagid:27110-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aW000 0aP200 0aK800 0aX3851 aHayhoe, Katharine10aEmissions pathways, climate change, and impacts on California  ap. 12422-12427.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe magnitude of future climate change depends substantially on the greenhouse gas emission pathways we choose. Here we explore the implications of the highest and lowest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions pathways for climate change and associated impacts in California. Based on climate projections from two state-of-the-art climate models with low and medium sensitivity (Parallel Climate Model and Hadley Centre Climate Model, version 3, respectively), we find that annual temperature increases nearly double from the lower B1 to the higher A1fi emissions scenario before 2100. Three of four simulations also show greater increases in summer temperatures as compared with winter. Extreme heat and the associated impacts on a range of temperature-sensitive sectors are substantially greater under the higher emissions scenario, with some interscenario differences apparent before midcentury. By the end of the century under the B1 scenario, heatwaves and extreme heat in Los Angeles quadruple in frequency while heat-related mortality increases two to three times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 50-75%; and Sierra snowpack is reduced 30-70%. Under A1fi, heatwaves in Los Angeles are six to eight times more frequent, with heat-related excess mortality increasing five to seven times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 75-90%; and snowpack declines 73-90%, with cascading impacts on runoff and streamflow that, combined with projected modest declines in winter precipitation, could fundamentally disrupt California's water rights system. Although interscenario differences in climate impacts and costs of adaptation emerge mainly in the second half of the century, they are strongly dependent on emissions from preceding decades.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agreenhouse gases 3agas emissions 3astream flow 3asnowpack 3ahumans 3aair temperature 3aglobal warming 3awatershed hydrology 3asummer 3aclimate models 3aenvironmental impact 3arunoff 3aair pollution 3aforest damage 3amortality 3aCalifornia 0aheat-related mortality 0aclimate change1 aCayan, Daniel1 aField, Christopher B.1 aFrumhoff, Peter C.1 aMaurer, Edwin P.1 aMiller, Norman L.1 aMoser, Susanne C.1 aSchneider, Stephen H.1 aCahill, Kimberly Nicholas1 aCleland, Elsa E.1 aDale, Larry1 aDrapek, Ray1 aHanemann, R.

Objectives: We aimed to critically evaluate the extant and probable links between plant function and human health, drawing on the pertinent literature. Discussion: Here we provide a number of critical examples that range over various health concerns related to plant biology and climate change, including aerobiology, contact dermatitis, pharmacology, toxicology, and pesticide use. Conclusions: There are a number of clear links among climate change, plant biology, and public health that remain underappreciated by both plant scientists and health care providers. We demonstrate the importance of such links in our understanding of climate change impacts and provide a list of key questions that will help to integrate plant biology into the current paradigm regarding climate change and human health.  aPubAg article0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3apublic health 3abotanists 3ahealth care workers 3ahuman health 3aclimate change 3apharmacology 3atoxicology 3aplant biology 3aclimate 3apesticides 3acontact dermatitis 2aCarbon Dioxidexanalysis 2aClimate 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aHumans 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aPublic Health 0aplants1 aEpstein, Paul R.1 aSchlesinger, William H.0 tEnvironmental health perspectives EHP..g2009 Feb., v. 117, no. 2 p.155-158x1552-99247nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl5005  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/540953Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.115013Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl5005b1552-9924c117d2e155  fEnvironmental health perspectives EHP.  aissued  aIND446376899ExL  a2013-03-04  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/ind1/105998_EHP_Article.pdf  aARS submission  aUSDA/ARS  aJournal title changed from 'Environmental health perspectives EHP'  aBatch:61 annotated on 2012-10-19T10:21:32Z  aBatch:61 reviewed on 2012-11-13T18:00:01Z  aagid:54095  a2012-08-03  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.77 2012/03/23)  a463768904199nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002900098035002800127040001800155100018400173245009100357300001400448520163100462592002802093593001802121650001902139650003002158650001902188650002102207650002402228650001502252650001602267650002802283650003102311650002502342650001502367650002102382650001402403650001402417650002602431650001702457650001002474653001402484653001502498700013202513700011202645773015202757787003302909787001802942787002402960856007502984912001203059914004503071914004203116916001503158917001103173918002703184935002203211949001503233953006103248954006103309955003503370961001303405962004803418974001703466983001503483984001503498991624707590742620221118013333.0190807e20190803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065582742DNAL7 a10.1017/inp.2019.122doi  aagid:6558274-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiska, Lewis H.eauthoruResearch Plant Physiologist, Adaptive Cropping Systems Lab, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Beltsville, MD, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2980-398510aUnderstanding the nexus of rising CO₂, climate change, and evolution in weed biology  ap. 79-88.  aRapid increases in herbicide resistance have highlighted the ability of weeds to undergo genetic change within a short period of time. That change, in turn, has resulted in an increasing emphasis in weed science on the evolutionary ecology and potential adaptation of weeds to herbicide selection. Here we argue that a similar emphasis would also be invaluable for understanding another challenge that will profoundly alter weed biology: the rapid rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) and the associated changes in climate. Our review of the literature suggests that elevated CO₂ and climate change will impose strong selection pressures on weeds and that weeds will often have the capacity to respond with rapid adaptive evolution. Based on current data, climate change and rising CO₂ levels are likely to alter the evolution of agronomic and invasive weeds, with consequences for distribution, community composition, and herbicide efficacy. In addition, we identify four key areas that represent clear knowledge gaps in weed evolution: (1) differential herbicide resistance in response to a rapidly changing CO₂/climate confluence; (2) shifts in the efficacy of biological constraints (e.g., pathogens) and resultant selection shifts in affected weed species; (3) climate-induced phenological shifts in weed distribution, demography, and fitness relative to crop systems; and (4) understanding and characterization of epigenetics and the differential expression of phenotypic plasticity versus evolutionary adaptation. These consequences, in turn, should be of fundamental interest to the weed science community.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acommunity structure 3ademography 3aepigenetics 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agene expression regulation 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3ainvasive species 3apathogens 3aphenology 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aweed biology 3aweeds 0aselection 0aadaptation1 aBlumenthal, Dana M.eauthoruEcologist, Rangeland Resources Research, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Fort Collins, CO, USA1 aFranks, Steven J.eauthoruProfessor, Department of Biological Sciences, Fordham University, Bronx, NY, USA0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2019 Aug. 3, v. 12, no. 2 p.79-88dThe Weed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4194316x1939-747X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl419431640uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/inp.2019.123Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4194316b1939-747Xc12d2e79  fInvasive plant science and management  aBatch:2375  aissued2 aBioOneeprovider5DNAL  aIND6065582749ExL  a2019-12-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/bioone/inp.2019.12_front.xml.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/bioone/inp.2019.12_front.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/bioone/  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:2375 reviewed on 2019-12-18T11:00:04Z  aagid:6558274  a2019-08-07  a2019-12-1806857nab a2200829 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100018400171245010300355300001800458500002000476520195300496592002802449593001802477596004102495596004102536596008702577596004902664596004902713650002402762650001102786650002502797650001202822650001502834650002002849650001102869650001802880650002102898650002202919650001502941650000902956650001202965700014202977700015303119700018003272700018103452700019403633700015103827700014703978700015804125700014404283700013704427700012104564700017604685700018204861700013205043700017405175773012405349787003305473787001805506787002205524856007405546912001205620914004605632914002605678917001105704918004305715935002205758949001505780952001905795953005805814954006205872955003405934961001205968974001705980983001505997984001506012991624767550742620221117220344.0220515e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077729272DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.161562doi  aagid:7772927-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovick, Kimberly A.eauthoruO'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Indiana University—Bloomington, Bloomington, Indiana, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8431-087910aInforming Nature‐based Climate Solutions for the United States with the best‐available science  ap. 3778-3794.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNature‐based Climate Solutions (NbCS) are managed alterations to ecosystems designed to increase carbon sequestration or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While they have growing public and private support, the realizable benefits and unintended consequences of NbCS are not well understood. At regional scales where policy decisions are often made, NbCS benefits are estimated from soil and tree survey data that can miss important carbon sources and sinks within an ecosystem, and do not reveal the biophysical impacts of NbCS for local water and energy cycles. The only direct observations of ecosystem‐scale carbon fluxes, for example, by eddy covariance flux towers, have not yet been systematically assessed for what they can tell us about NbCS potentials, and state‐of‐the‐art remote sensing products and land‐surface models are not yet being widely used to inform NbCS policymaking or implementation. As a result, there is a critical mismatch between the point‐ and tree‐scale data most often used to assess NbCS benefits and impacts, the ecosystem and landscape scales where NbCS projects are implemented, and the regional to continental scales most relevant to policymaking. Here, we propose a research agenda to confront these gaps using data and tools that have long been used to understand the mechanisms driving ecosystem carbon and energy cycling, but have not yet been widely applied to NbCS. We outline steps for creating robust NbCS assessments at both local to regional scales that are informed by ecosystem‐scale observations, and which consider concurrent biophysical impacts, future climate feedbacks, and the need for equitable and inclusive NbCS implementation strategies. We contend that these research goals can largely be accomplished by shifting the scales at which pre‐existing tools are applied and blended together, although we also highlight some opportunities for more radical shifts in approach.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a1552747cNational Science Foundation  a1752083cNational Science Foundation  cIndiana University Bloomington, O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs  cU.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science  cStanford Woods Institute for the Environment 3aBiological Sciences 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy 3aglobal change 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3asoil 3asurveys1 aMetzger, StefaneauthoruBattelle, National Ecological Observatory Network, Boulder, Colorado, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4201-852X1 aAnderegg, William R.

The global warming trend which has taken place since the 1950s, that is 2-3 times the reported global warming and the continuous presence of extreme events makes this region a live laboratory to study the impact of climate change. In this review, we first present the current knowledge on climate change in the Andes, as compared to changes in other mountain areas, and the globe in general. Then, the review describes the ecophysiological strategies to cope and adapt to changes in atmospheric CO₂ levels, temperature and soil water availability. As climate change also has a significant effect on the magnitude and frequency of the incidence of pests and diseases, the current knowledge of the dynamics of vectors in the Andean region is discussed. The use of modeling techniques to describe changes in the range expansion and number of insect pest generations per year as affected by increases in temperature is also presented. Finally, the review deals with the use of crop modeling to analyze the likely impact of projected climate scenarios on potato yield and tuber initiation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodiversity 3acarbon dioxide 3acenter of origin 3aclimate 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3aecophysiology 3aglobal warming 3ainsect pests 3aplant available water 3apotatoes 3atemperature 3atubers 3aAndes region 0aAndes 0acrop modeling 0aglobal warming 0apest 0aSolanum spp1 aRamírez, David A.eauthoruInternational Potato Center, Headquarters,Lima12, Peru1 aKroschel, JürgeneauthoruInternational Potato Center, Asia Potato Program,New Delhi, India1 aAndrade-Piedra, JorgeeauthoruInternational Potato Center, Headquarters,Lima12, Peru1 aBarreda, CarolinaeauthoruInternational Potato Center, Headquarters,Lima12, Peru1 aCondori, BrunoeauthoruAdaptive Cropping Systems Laboratory, USDA-ARS,Beltsville, USA1 aMares, VictoreauthoruInternational Potato Center, Headquarters,Lima12, Peru1 aMonneveux, PhilippeeauthoruInternational Potato Center, Headquarters,Lima12, Peru1 aPerez, WillmereauthoruInternational Potato Center, Headquarters,Lima12, Peru0 tOpen Agriculture.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 3, no. 1 p.273-283dSciendowJournal:23162x2391-95317nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2316240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2018-00293Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:23162b2391-9531c3d1e273  fOpen Agriculture  aBatch:2076  aissued2 aDe Gruyter Publisherseprovider5DNAL  aIND6060907439ExL  a2019-04-19  a/data/metadata/incoming/degruyter/opag.2018.3.issue-1-1555699313751.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/degruyter/opag-2018-0029.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/degruyter/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6090743  a2019-04-19  a2022-07-2704520nab a2200769 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004200098024003900140024004600179035002800225040001800253100010000271245016700371300001400538506002800552506004300580506007600623506003100699520152700730592002802257593001802285596006002303506003702363650003602400650003102436650001702467650001902484650001902503650002302522650002902545650001302574650001602587650001602603650000802619650001002627651001102637651001802648653001602666653001902682653003302701653002302734653002602757700009702783773017502880787003303055787001803088787002403106856008603130903002203216912001203238914004503250914008303295916001503378917001103393918004303404935002203447949001503469953009303484954007203577955004203649961001203691974001703703983001503720984001503735991625130300742620221207142542.0190128e20171129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059568482DNAL7 a10.1080/21513732.2017.12858152chorus7 a10.1080/21513732.2017.12858152doi7 a10.1080/21513732.2017.12858152chorusOpen  aagid:5956848-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatthews, Stephen N.eauthoruNorthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Delaware, OH, USA10aManaging for delicious ecosystem service under climate change: can United States sugar maple (Acer saccharum) syrup production be maintained in a warming climate?  ap. 40-52.  aResource is Open Access  aInforma UK Limited License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aSugar maple (Acer saccharum) is a highly valued tree in United States (US) and Canada, and its sap when collected from taps and concentrated, makes a delicious syrup. Understanding how this resource may be impacted by climate change and other threats is essential to continue management for maple syrup into the future. Here, we evaluate the current distribution of maple syrup production across twenty-three states within the US and estimate the current potential sugar maple resource based on tree inventory data. We model and project the potential habitat responses of sugar maple using a species distribution model with climate change under two future General Circulation Models (GCM) and emission scenarios and three time periods (2040, 2070, 2100). Our results show that under GFDL-A1Fi (high CO₂ emissions), sugar maple habitat is projected to decline (mean ratio of future habitat to current habitat per state = 0.46, sd ± 0.33), which could lead to reduced maple syrup production per tree and nearly 5 million additional taps required to maintain current projection levels. If global emissions are reduced and follow a lower trajectory of warming (under PCM-B1), then habitat for the species may be maintained but would still require management intervention. Finally, our results point to regions, particularly along the northern tier, where both climate change impacts and currently developing sugar maple habitat may signify viable opportunities to increase maple syrup production.EDITED BY Christine Fürst  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000069590 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcer saccharum subsp. saccharum 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3abiogeography 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahabitats 3ainventories 3amaple syrup 3asap 3atrees 3aCanada 3aUnited States 0aMaple syrup 0aclimate change 0asugar maple (Acer saccharum) 0aecosystem services 0aEastern United States1 aIverson, Louis R.eauthoruNorthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Delaware, OH, USA0 tInternational journal of biodiversity science, ecosystem services & management.g2017 Nov. 29, v. 13, no. 2 p.40-52dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000091x2151-37407nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)J00000009140uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2017.12858153Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aArticle  aJournal:J000000091b2151-3740c13d2e40  fInternational journal of biodiversity science, ecosystem services & management  aBatch:2012  aissued2 aTaylor & Francis Groupeprovider5DNAL  aIND6059568489ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/taylorfrancis/tbsm21_tbsm21.v013.i02_20190116023351#15810335.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/taylorfrancis/21513732.2017.1285815.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/taylorfrancis/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:5956848  a2019-01-28  a2022-09-0604661nab a2200877 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098024003600137024004300173035002800216040001800244100014500262245006900407300001600476506007600492506003100568520149500599592002802094593001802122596008302140506003702223650001602260650004102276650001302317650001902330650001902349650000902368650001502377650001402392650001902406650001502425650001302440650001802453650000902471650001102480650001302491650001602504650001802520650001602538650002102554650001502575651001302590653002202603653001902625653000902644653001502653653001502668653001602683700015102699700012002850773011802970787003303088787001803121787001903139856008303158856004503241912001203286914003703298914004303335916001503378917001103393918003603404935002203440949001503462953007003477954007103547955004503618961000903663962004703672962001703719974001703736983001503753984001503768991625271830742620221215142607.0190417e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054460172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2014.12.0032chorus7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2014.12.0032doi7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2014.12.0032chorusOpen  aagid:5446017-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoznicki, Sean A.eauthoruDepartment of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States10aClimate change and irrigation demand: Uncertainty and adaptation  ap. 247-264.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe Kalamazoo River Watershed, southwest Michigan, USA.Climate change is projected to have significant impacts on agricultural production. Therefore, understanding the regional impacts of climate change on irrigation demand for crop production is important for watershed managers and agricultural producers to understand for effective water resources management. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to assess the impact of climate change on corn and soybean irrigation demand in the Kalamazoo River Watershed. Bias-corrected statistically downscaled climate change data from ten global climate models and four emissions scenarios were used in SWAT to develop projections of irrigation demand and yields for 2020–2039 and 2060–2079. Six adaptation scenarios were developed to shift the planting dates (planting earlier and later in the growing season) to take advantage of periods with greater rainfall or lower temperature increases.Uncertainty in irrigation demand was found to increase moving from 2020–2039 to 2060–2079, with demand generally decreasing moving further into the future for corn and soybean. A shift in timing of peak irrigation demand and increases in temperature lead to corn yield reductions. However, soybean yield increased under these conditions. Finally, the adaptation strategy of planting earlier increased irrigation demand and water available for transpiration, while delaying planting resulted in demand decreases for both crops.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycine max 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aZea mays 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acorn 3acrop yield 3aemissions 3agrowing season 3airrigation 3amanagers 3aplanting date 3arain 3arivers 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3atranspiration 3auncertainty 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aMichigan 0aIrrigation demand 0aClimate change 0aSWAT 0aCrop yield 0aAdaptation 0aUncertainty1 aNejadhashemi, A.

Thus, this work aims to assess the worldwide regionalization of the SST evolution for the 21ˢᵗ century under the influence of climate change by means of: 1) division of the worldwide SST data in regions applying a K-means cluster procedure and validation of the most suitable CMIP5 models by a comparative analysis with SST data from Era-Interim reanalysis; 2) calculation of SST trends along the 21ˢᵗ century and assessment of future SST differences between RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios and historical SST data. Global climate model (GCM) projections show a SST warming worldwide although with different intensity depending on the region. Northern Hemisphere regions present a higher seasonal thermal amplitude comparing with equivalent regions in the Southern Hemisphere. Northern Hemisphere has also a higher annual SST increment than clusters in the Southern Hemisphere, independently of the future time period and climate scenario. The Northern Sub-Tropical cluster (STRN) shows the highest significant increment (4.34 °C on RCP 8.5). Under the RCP 4.5 climate scenario, SST trends from 1975 to 2100 range from 0.075 °C dec⁻¹ at South Polar cluster (PRS) to 0.21 °C dec⁻¹ at STRN cluster. Relatively to RCP 8.5 climatic scenario, SST trends change from 0.13 °C dec⁻¹ at PRS cluster to 0.36 °C dec⁻¹ at the North Polar cluster (PRN).  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3asurface water temperature 0aSST variability 0aCMIP5 0aGlobal warming 0aK-means cluster1 aSousa, M.C.eauthoruCESAM, Departamento de Física, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal1 adeCastro, M.eauthoruEnvironmental Physics Laboratiry (EphysLab), CIM-UVIGO, Universidade de Vigo, Edificio Campus da Auga, 32004 Ourense, Spain1 aDias, J.M.eauthoruCESAM, Departamento de Física, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2020 July, v. 190 p.103190-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1240640uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.1031903Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:12406b0921-8181e103190  fGlobal and planetary change  aBatch:2469  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6068840199ExL  a2020-05-15  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/181312169130961219-00003-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0921818120300813.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/DA  aagid:6884019  a2020-06-01  a2020-06-0104348nab a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098035002800137040001800165100017300183245013900356300001600495520135600511592002801867593001801895650003101913650004101944650001201985650001901997650002402016650001602040650001602056650001602072650002102088651001102109653001602120653002002136653001002156653001902166653000902185653001502194700018102209700016902390700018502559700013302744700013402877773012003011787003303131787001803164787002203182856008603204912001203290914003203302914002503334916001503359917001103374918003603385935002203421949001503443953006003458954006103518955003503579961001303614974001703627983001503644984001503659991625639250742620221118014925.0190318e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061908272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.10.0412doi  aagid:6190827-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, JungangeauthoruBlackland Research and Extension Center, Texas A&M University, 720 E.

However, another source of uncertainty, the observed climate data source used to statistically downscale and bias-correct GCM projections, has largely been overlooked. This study assessed the shifts, variability, and uncertainty in streamflow simulation from three downscaling data sources (NCDC land-based weather stations, NEXRAD spatial grid, and PRISM spatial grid) relative to those introduced by six GCMs and three RCPs in west-central Kansas, U.S. Streamflow simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model was found to be more sensitive to future precipitation than to maximum and minimum temperatures. The greatest uncertainty in simulated streamflow was associated with selection of the GCM. Uncertainty in simulated streamflow associated with the observed bias-correction data source (NCDC, PRISM, NEXRAD) was greater than with RCPs and was primarily related to uncertainty in precipitation. This study highlighted the importance of recognizing uncertainty from bias-correction data sources in representing future climate scenarios in hydrologic simulations.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ameteorological data 3astream flow 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3aweather stations 3aKansas 0aUncertainty 0aBias correction 0aCMIP5 0aClimate change 0aSWAT 0aStreamflow1 aSheshukov, Aleksey Y.eauthoruBiological & Agricultural Engineering, Kansas State University, 1016 Seaton Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4842-908X1 aYen, HaweauthoruBlackland Research and Extension Center, Texas A&M University, 720 E.

White fir (Abies concolor) had the highest variability, gross photosynthetic rate (Pg), and foliar carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content. Despite low water use efficiency (WUE), stomatal conductance (gs) of fir was the most responsive to unfavorable environmental conditions. Pinus lambertiana exhibited the least variability in Pg and WUE, and is likely to be the most vulnerable to environmental changes. Pinus ponderosa had an intermediate level of variability, and high needle growth at its higher elevational limits. Pinus Jeffreyi also had intermediate variability, but high needle growth at its southern latitudinal and lower elevational limits. The attributes used to assess tree vigor were effective in predicting population vulnerability to abiotic (drought) and biotic (herbivore) stresses. Variability in ecophysiological attributes of western U.S. conifers suggests relative capacity of species and populations to respond to environmental change.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aAbies concolor 3aPinus ponderosa 3aPinus jeffreyi 3aPinus lambertiana 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal conductance 3agas exchange 3anitrogen content 3acarbon 3aconifer needles 3awater use efficiency 3aaltitude 3alatitude 3atree growth 2aAltitude 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aClimate Change 2aConiferophytaxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology 2aPlant Physiological Processes 2aPlant Stomataxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology 2aWaterxmetabolism 2aWeather 3aOregon 3aCalifornia 3aMexico 0aSouthwestern United States0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2010 June, v.  158, no.  6 p.2032-2042x0269-74917nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl41014  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/452333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.12.0103Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl41014b0269-7491c158d6e2032  fEnvironmental pollution  aissued  a20120830b20120904c00000000  aIND443930779ExL  aINDdRHFe2010/11/08  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20120830 20120904 00000000bIND RHF 2010/11/08  aUSDA/FS  aagid:45233  a2012-09-04  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a439307703848nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002500097024002100122035002600143040001800169072001700187072001700204072001700221072001700238100002300255245006700278300001800345500014000363500002400503500002300527500001500550520131800565593001801883593002001901650001901921650001701940650002401957650002601981650001902007650001702026650002202043650001702065651001102082653002202093653001902115700002602134700002902160700002202189700002502211700002202236773011402258787001802372787003302390787003002423787002102453852000902474856007502483856011202558912001202670914004402682914004002726917001102766930003302777935002102810945002502831946001102856949001502867952005102882961001202933974001502945984001502960985010302975986001203078991625720660742620221118020426.0100810e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444109932DNAL7 a10.1139/X10-0612doi7 a10113/451562hdl  aagid:45156-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This high resilience of forest stands to fire disturbance is supported by two interrelated feedback cycles: (i) interactions among disturbance regime and plant–soil–microbial feedbacks that regulate soil organic layer thickness and the cycling of energy and materials, and (ii) interactions among soil conditions, plant regeneration traits, and plant effects on the environment that maintain stable cycles of forest community composition. Unusual fire events can disrupt these cycles and trigger a regime shift of forest stands from one stability domain to another (e.g., from conifer to deciduous forest dominance). This may lead to abrupt shifts in forest cover in response to changing climate and fire regime, particularly at sites with intermediate levels of moisture availability where stand-scale feedback cycles are only weakly constrained by environmental conditions. However, the loss of resilience in individual stands may foster resilience at the landscape scale, if changes in the landscape configuration of forest cover types feedback to stabilize regional patterns of fire behavior and climate conditions.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aboreal forests 3afire ecology 3asoil organic matter 3abotanical composition 3aclimate change 3aforest soils 3astand composition 3aforest fires 3aAlaska 0acommunity ecology 0aforest ecology1 aChapin, F.

We examined productivity and soil C dynamics under two climate change scenarios (moderate warming, representative concentration pathway [RCP] 4.5; and high warming, RCP 8.5), using long‐term experimental data and the DayCent process‐based model for three sites with varying climates and soil conditions in the US High Plains. Each site included a no‐till cropping intensity gradient introduced in 1985, with treatments ranging from wheat–fallow (Triticum aestivum L.) to continuous annual cropping and perennial grass. Simulations were extended to 2100 using data from 16 global circulation models to estimate uncertainty. Simulated yields declined for all crops (up to 50% for wheat), with small changes after 2050 under RCP 4.5 and continued losses to 2100 under RCP 8.5. Of the cropped systems, continuous cropping had the highest average productivity and soil C sequestration rates (78.1 kg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ from 2015 to 2045 under RCP 4.5). Any increase in soil C for cropped rotations was realized by 2050, but grassland treatments increased soil C (up to 69%) through 2100, even under RCP 8.5. Our simulations indicate that reduced frequency of summer fallow can both increase annualized yields and store more soil C. As evapotranspiration is likely to increase, reducing fallow periods without live vegetation from dryland agricultural rotations may enhance the resilience of these systems to climate change while also increasing soil C storage and mitigating carbon dioxide emissions. CORE IDEAS: Soil C sequestration rates increased with cropping intensity. Water‐limited systems will see increased yield losses under climate change. Intensive systems retained soil C but with more variability under climate change. Grasslands are likely to sequester more soil C than annual cropping systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a58‐5402‐4‐016cUSDA‐ARS 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagroecosystems 3aarid lands 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3aemissions 3aevapotranspiration 3afallow 3agrasslands 3amodels 3ano-tillage 3aperennial grasses 3arowcrops 3asoil 3asoil carbon 3asoil quality 3asummer 3auncertainty 3awheat 3aHigh Plains (United States) 3aUnited States1 aZhang, YaoeauthoruUSDA‐ARS, Agricultural Systems Research Unit, 2150 Centre Ave, Building D, Fort Collins, CO, 805261 aSherrod, Lucretia A.eauthoruUSDA‐ARS, Agricultural Systems Research Unit, 2150 Centre Ave, Building D, Fort Collins, CO, 805261 aRosenzweig, Steven T.eauthoruDep. of Soil and Crop Sciences, Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO, 805231 aMa, LiwangeauthoruUSDA‐ARS, Agricultural Systems Research Unit, 2150 Centre Ave, Building D, Fort Collins, CO, 805261 aAhuja, LajpateauthoruUSDA‐ARS, Agricultural Systems Research Unit, 2150 Centre Ave, Building D, Fort Collins, CO, 805261 aSchipanski, Meagan E.eauthoruDep. of Soil and Crop Sciences, Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO, 805230 tJournal of environmental quality.g2018 July, v. 47, no. 4 p.684-694dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl164240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2017.08.03093Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl1642b0047-2425c47d4e684  fJournal of environmental quality  aBatch:2360  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6066647649ExL  a2020-02-20  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/00472425_2018_47_4.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/00472425_2018_47_4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6664764  a2022-08-11  a2022-08-1104786nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003300098035002800131040001800159100013100177245011000308300001600418500002000434500000900454520192700463592002802390593001802418650002002436650001202456650001902468650001502487650002102502650002002523650001102543650001502554650001502569650002402584651001302608651002402621700016002645700008002805700012602885700008103011700012403092700012903216773021703345787003303562787001803595787002103613856008003634912001203714914004303726914003703769916001503806917001103821918004303832935002203875949001503897953005703912954006103969955003404030961001304064974001704077983001504094984001504109991626157130742620221118040501.0220811e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066648362DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2017.07.02912doi  aagid:6664836-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavigelli, M.

The objective of this study was to simulate the impact of projected climate change on SOC to 50‐cm soil depth for grain cropping systems in the southern Mid‐Atlantic region of the United States. We used SOC and other data from the long‐term Farming Systems Project in Beltsville, MD, and CQESTR, a process‐based soil C model, to predict the impact of cropping systems and climate (air temperature and precipitation) on SOC for a 40‐yr period (2012–2052). Since future crop yields are uncertain, we simulated five scenarios with differing yield levels (crop yields from 1996–2014, and at 10 or 30% greater or lesser than these yields). Without change in climate or crop yields (baseline conditions) CQESTR predicted an increase in SOC of 0.014 and 0.021 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in CT and NT, respectively. Predicted climate change alone resulted in an SOC increase of only 0.002 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in NT and a decrease of 0.017 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in CT. Crop yield declines of 10 and 30% led to SOC decreases between 2 and 8% compared with 2012 levels. Increasing crop yield by 10 and 30% was sufficient to raise SOC 2 and 7%, respectively, above the climate‐only scenario under both CT and NT between 2012 and 2052. Results indicate that under these simulated conditions, the negative impact of climate change on SOC levels could be mitigated by crop yield increases. CORE IDEAS: Soil organic C was greater in a no‐till than a conventional tillage system. CQESTR model‐simulated soil organic C increased under both systems. CQESTR‐simulated soil organic C decreased under climate change. Simulated soil organic C decreased under climate change when yields were reduced. Simulated soil organic C increased under climate change when yields were increased.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3afarming systems 3amodels 3ano-tillage 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3aMaryland 3aMid-Atlantic region1 aNash, P.

CO₂ increase to 540 ppm partially compensates yield losses due to increased temperatures. Accounting for soil feedbacks is critical when evaluating climate change impacts on crop yield. A critical omission from climate change impact studies on crop yield is the interaction between soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) availability, and carbon dioxide (CO₂). We used a multimodel ensemble to predict the effects of SOC and N under different scenarios of temperatures and CO₂ concentrations on maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in eight sites across the world. We found that including feedbacks from SOC and N losses due to increased temperatures would reduce yields by 13% in wheat and 19% in maize for a 3°C rise temperature with no adaptation practices. These losses correspond to an additional 4.5% (+3°C) when compared to crop yield reductions attributed to temperature increase alone. Future CO₂ increase to 540 ppm would partially compensate losses by 80% for both maize and wheat at +3°C, and by 35% for wheat and 20% for maize at +6°C, relative to the baseline CO₂ scenario.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop yield 3anitrogen 3asoil organic carbon 3atemperature 3awheat1 aDumont, B.eauthoruTerra & AgroBioChem Dep., Gembloux Agro‐Bio Tech–Univ. of Liege, Gembloux, Belgium1 aMaestrini, B.eauthoruDep. of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI, USA1 aShcherbak, I.eauthoruW.K.

Therefore, this study examined the sensitivity of cypress-pine flatwoods hydrology to climate change and forest management by using the physically based, distributed hydrologic modeling system, MIKE SHE. The model was first calibrated and validated with a long-term data set, and then applied using several hypothetical scenarios developed in north central Florida. Our study showed that MIKE SHE could simulate the temporal and spatial dynamics of the shallow ground-water table. The model also identified and confirmed three horizontal ground-water flow patterns at this study site. The modeling results suggested that forest removal and climate change (i.e., warming and drying) would have pronounced impacts on the ground-water table during the dry periods, but these impacts may be minor under wet conditions at this typical flatwoods landscape. At the landscape scale, depressional wetlands may have higher responses to tree removal and climate change than surrounding uplands.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3asimulation models 3aclearcutting 3aclimate change 3aforest management 3alowland forests 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3awater table 0aMIKE SHE model 0ahydrology1 aSun, GeeauthoruSouthern Global Change Program, Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 920 Main Campus Drive, Venture II, Suite 300, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA 276061 aMcNulty, Steven G.eauthoruSouthern Global Change Program, Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 920 Main Campus Drive, Venture II, Suite 300, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA 276061 aComerford, Nicholas B.eauthoruSoil and Water Science Department, University of Florida, 2169 McCarty Hall Box 110290, Gainesville, Florida, USA 326110 tWetlands.g2009 Sept., v. 29, no. 3 p.826-836dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl57834  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/379163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672/07-162.13Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57834b0277-5212c29d3e826–836  fWetlands  aissued2 aBioOneeprovider5DNAL  a20100127b20100205c00000000  aIND443056589ExL  aINDdLYNe2010/01/27  a2016-09-13  a20100127 20100205 00000000bIND LYN 2010/01/27  aWETLv29i3-04290118-175309.zip  aUSDA/FS  aagid:37916  a2018-05-25  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a430565804630nab a2201057 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004200097024002100139035002600160040001800186072000900204072000900213072000900222072000900231100002300240245013500263300001600398500002400414500001500438520139500453593001801848593002001866650001701886650001201903650001301915650002301928650002601951650002901977650002002006650001602026650001702042650001902059650002402078650001902102650002502121650001602146650001002162650002102172653002202193653001802215653001802233653003002251653002602281653003202307653002402339653001902363653001502382653002202397653002102419653001202440653001802452653001502470653002602485700001902511700001902530700002202549700002202571700001802593700001602611700001702627700001902644700001902663700001902682700002502701700002202726773010402748787001802852787003302870787003002903787002202933852000902955856011202964856009203076912001203168914004403180914002303224917001103247930003303258935002103291945002503312946001103337949001503348952005103363961001303414974001503427984001503442985010303457986001203560991626927390742620221118034434.0100129e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443194052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01618.x2doi7 a10113/443332hdl  aagid:44333-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aB200 0aJ2001 aTravers, Steven E.10aVariation in gene expression of Andropogon gerardii in response to altered environmental conditions associated with climate change  ap. 374-383.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a1. If we are to understand the mechanisms underlying species responses to climate change in natural systems, studies are needed that focus on responses of non-model species under field conditions. We measured transcriptional profiles of individuals of Andropogon gerardii, a C₄ grass native to North American grasslands, in a field experiment in which both temperature and precipitation were manipulated to simulate key aspects of forecasted climate change. 2. By using microarrays developed for a closely related model species, Zea mays, we were able to compare the relative influence of warming versus altered soil moisture availability on expression levels of over 7000 genes, identify responsive functional groups of genes and correlate changes in gene transcription with physiological responses. 3. We observed more statistically significant shifts in transcription levels of genes in response to thermal stress than in response to water stress. We also identified candidate genes that demonstrated transcription levels closely associated with physiological variables, in particular chlorophyll fluorescence. 4.Synthesis. These results suggest that an ecologically important species responds differently to different environmental aspects of forecast climate change. These translational changes have the potential to influence phenotypic characters and ultimately adaptive responses.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3ametagenomics 3agrasses 3aZea mays 3asoil water content 3amicroarray technology 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aheat stress 3awater stress 3aplant response 3aAndropogon gerardii 3aglobal warming 3aphenotypic variation 3atemperature 3agenes 3aclimatic factors 0atallgrass prairie 0agene function 0aprecipitation 0aprecipitation variability 0atranscription profile 0aRainfall Manipulation Plots 0aenrichment analysis 0aclimate change 0amicroarray 0anon-model species 0aplant physiology 0awarming 0aGene Ontology 0aadaptation 0aenvironmental factors1 aTang, Zhongwen1 aCaragea, Doina1 aGarrett, Karen A.1 aHulbert, Scott H.1 aLeach, Jan E.1 aBai, Jianfa1 aSaleh, Amgad1 aKnapp, Alan K.1 aFay, Philip A.1 aNippert, Jesse1 aSchnable, Patrick S.1 aSmith, Melinda D.0 tJournal of ecology.g2010 Mar., v.  98, no.  2 p.374-383dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl44660  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/443333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01618.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44660b0022-0477c98d2e374  fJournal of ecology  aissued  a20101025b20101108c00000000  aIND443194059ExL  aINDdLYNe2010/10/12  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20101025 20101108 00000000bIND LYN 2010/10/12  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:44333  a2012-06-07  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a431940506024nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100013700171245010000308300001600408500002000424520254100444592002802985593001803013650002103031650001703052650001203069650001903081650002403100650001803124650002203142650001303164650001103177650002203188650002003210650001503230650001303245650002303258650001303281650002203294650001203316650002203328650002203350650002003372650001003392651001103402700017903413700014003592700012003732700013303852700013503985700015104120700012604271700012304397700012804520773011204648787003304760787001804793787002204811856007304833912001204906914004404918914002804962916001504990917001105005918004305016935002205059949001505081953002705096961001205123962004805135974001705183983001505200984001505215991627038310742620221118041008.0160903e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054791202DNAL7 a10.1890/13-0906.12doi  aagid:5479120-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYospin, Gabriel I.eauthoruInstitute on Ecosystems, Montana State University, 106 AJM Johnson Hall, Bozeman, Montana 59717-3490 USA12aA new model to simulate climate‐change impacts on forest succession for local land management  ap. 226-242.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe developed a new climate‐sensitive vegetation state‐and‐transition simulation model (CV‐STSM) to simulate future vegetation at a fine spatial grain commensurate with the scales of human land‐use decisions, and under the joint influences of changing climate, site productivity, and disturbance. CV‐STSM integrates outputs from four different modeling systems. Successional changes in tree species composition and stand structure were represented as transition probabilities and organized into a state‐and‐transition simulation model. States were characterized based on assessments of both current vegetation and of projected future vegetation from a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). State definitions included sufficient detail to support the integration of CV‐STSM with an agent‐based model of land‐use decisions and a mechanistic model of fire behavior and spread. Transition probabilities were parameterized using output from a stand biometric model run across a wide range of site productivities. Biogeographic and biogeochemical projections from the DGVM were used to adjust the transition probabilities to account for the impacts of climate change on site productivity and potential vegetation type. We conducted experimental simulations in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. Our simulation landscape incorporated detailed new assessments of critically imperiled Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) savanna and prairie habitats among the suite of existing and future vegetation types. The experimental design fully crossed four future climate scenarios with three disturbance scenarios. CV‐STSM showed strong interactions between climate and disturbance scenarios. All disturbance scenarios increased the abundance of oak savanna habitat, but an interaction between the most intense disturbance and climate‐change scenarios also increased the abundance of subtropical tree species. Even so, subtropical tree species were far less abundant at the end of simulations in CV‐STSM than in the dynamic global vegetation model simulations. Our results indicate that dynamic global vegetation models may overestimate future rates of vegetation change, especially in the absence of stand‐replacing disturbances. Modeling tools such as CV‐STSM that simulate rates and direction of vegetation change affected by interactions and feedbacks between climate and land‐use change can help policy makers, land managers, and society as a whole develop effective plans to adapt to rapidly changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aQuercus garryana 3abiogeography 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aexperimental design 3afire behavior 3aforest succession 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3amechanistic models 3asavannas 3asimulation models 3asociety 3aspecies diversity 3astand composition 3astand structure 3atrees 3aOregon1 aBridgham, Scott D.eauthoruEnvironmental Sciences Institute and Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Oregon, 5289 University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon 97403 USA1 aNeilson, Ronald P.eauthoruBotany and Plant Pathology, Oregon State University, 1895 S.W.

Establishing the extent of these biological responses as the system approaches a new equilibrium allows us more reliably to emulate comparable native systems. That is, the sensitivity of analyzing ecosystem processes in a reconstructed system is improved by excluding the period when observed phenomena are primarily responses caused by establishing the experiment rather than effects of imposed treatments; achieved by determining the extent of any pulse of activity caused by preparatory procedures. A native forest soil was physically disrupted when it was collected, sieved, and then rebuilt in lysimeters in a controlled-environment study evaluating the influence of elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentration and elevated atmospheric temperature on the reconstructed soil that was planted with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. Franco) seedlings. Generally, soil food web populations responded in two phases during the exposure as indicated by preliminary evaluation of the 4.5-year dataset. Also, previous work indicated that relatively elevated soil CO₂ effluxes occurred during the first phase, suggesting that food web populations may have responded to carbon sources made available when the soil was harvested and its profile reconstructed in the lysimeters. Results are presented for bacterial and fungal biomass, numbers of protozoa and nematodes to gain insight on whether the first phase responses are attributable to the acute stress of physically disrupting the soil. We found clear relationships between changes in predator and prey populations. A prominent spike for many of the food web populations occurred the year after the climate exposures began. Except for total bacterial biomass and total fungal-hyphae biomass, overall food web responses generally were unrelated to treatments. It appears that initial food web population responses were related to increased availability of soil carbon caused by establishing the experiment. Our results provide insights into determining the length of time to maintain reconstructed forest ecosystems before responses are observed related to experimental treatments. It appears that as long as 3 years elapsed before the soil food web appeared to recover from the acute physical disturbance; 1 year of recovery prior to commencing the climate exposures to allow the soil to rest after it was reconstructed, plus approximately the first 2 years of maintaining the climate treatments. Accounting for consequences of such periods of adjustment is critical for forecasting whether comparable natural ecosystems will be net sources or sinks of elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO₂.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3asoil fungi 3acarbon dioxide 3asoil bacteria 3aforest trees 3asoil nematodes 3aair temperature 3aProtozoa 3asoil food webs 3aclimate change 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3alysimeters 3apredator-prey relationships 3aforest soils 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3adisturbed soils 3apopulation ecology 0asoil ecology1 aMonleon, Vicente J.1 aIngham, Elaine R.1 aMartin, Kendall J.1 aJohnson, Mark G.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2010 May, v.  45, no.  1 p.26-38dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl55717  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/418293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.01.0063Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl55717b0929-1393c45d1e26  fApplied soil ecology  aissued  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aIND443458079ExL  aINDd9CTe2010/05/05  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20110518 20110603 00000000bIND 9CT 2010/05/05  aUSDA/FS  aagid:41829  a2011-06-03  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a434580704748nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100023000182245010400412520127600516592002801792593001801820650002101838650001501859650001901874650001401893650001101907650001501918650001101933650001601944650001001960651001101970651001301981651001201994651001402006651001902020651001102039653002702050653003102077653001702108653001002125653001202135700015902147700021802306700018102524700015702705700020502862700022203067773011603289787003303405787001803438787001803456856008503474912001203559914004303571914003403614916001603648917001103664918003603675935002203711949001503733952001903748953009103767954006103858955003503919961001303954974001703967983001503984984001503999991627834660742620221118041417.0211017e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074810732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1018122doi  aagid:7481073-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilar-Domínguez, MarieleauthoruLaboratorio de Parasitología, Rancho Torreón del Molino, Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia, Universidad Veracruzana, Circunvalación y Yáñez s/n, C.P. 91710 Veracruz, México10aPotential distribution of Amblyomma mixtum (Koch, 1844) in climate change scenarios in the Americas  aAmblyomma mixtum is a Neotropical generalist tick of medical and veterinary importance which is widely distributed from United States of America to Ecuador. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the geographic projections of the ecological niche models of A. mixtum in climate change scenarios in America. We constructed a database of published scientific publications, personal collections, personal communications, and online databases. Ecological niche modelling was performed with 15 Bioclimatic variables using kuenm in R and was projected to three time periods (Last Glacial Maximum, Current and 2050) for America. Our model indicated a wide distribution for A. mixtum, with higher probability of occurrence along the Gulf of Mexico and occurring in a lesser proportion in the Pacific states, Central America, and the northern part of South America. The areas of new invasion are located mainly on the border of Mexico with Guatemala and Belize, some regions of Central America and Colombia. We conclude that the ecological niche modelling are effective tools to infer the potential distribution of A. mixtum in America, in addition to helping to propose future measures of epidemiological control and surveillance in the new potential areas of invasion.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aAmblyomma mixtum 3aNeotropics 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aniches 3aprobability 3aticks 3aBelize 3aColombia 3aEcuador 3aGuatemala 3aGulf of Mexico 3aMexico 0aPotential distribution 0aEcological niche modelling 0aEctoparasite 0aKuenm 0aAmerica1 aMoo-Llanes, David A.eauthoruCentro Regional de Investigación en Salud Pública, Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública, Tapachula 30700, Chiapas, México1 aSánchez-Montes, SokanieauthoruFacultad de Ciencias Biológicas y Agropecuarias, Región Tuxpan, Universidad Veracruzana, Tuxpan de Rodríguez Cano, 92870 Veracruz, México1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6316-21871 aBecker, IngeborgeauthoruCentro de Medicina Tropical, División de Investigación, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City, 06726, México1 aFeria-Arroyo, Teresa PatriciaeauthoruDepartment of Biology, The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, 1201W University Drive Edinburg, TX 78539, USA.1 ade León, Adalberto PérezeauthoruUSDA-ARS Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock Insects Research Laboratory and Veterinary Pest Genomics Center, Kerrville, TX, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4115-77471 aRomero-Salas, DoraeauthoruLaboratorio de Parasitología, Rancho Torreón del Molino, Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia, Universidad Veracruzana, Circunvalación y Yáñez s/n, C.P. 91710 Veracruz, México0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2021 Nov., v. 12, no. 6 p.101812-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)630540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1018123Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:6305b1877-959Xc12d6e101812  fTicks and tick-borne diseases  aBatch:10185  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6074810739ExL  a2022-02-22  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/741433015880049376-00004-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S1877959X21001655.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:7481073  a2021-10-17  a2022-02-1706149nab a2200889 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004000098024003700138035002800175040001800203100013600221245014400357300001400501506007600515506003100591520204600622592002802668593001802696596007002714596006402784596006402848596006202912596007002974506003703044650003103081650004103112650001203153650001503165650003003180650001203210650001903222650000903241650001503250650001003265650001603275650002303291650001103314650002603325650002403351650001603375651001003391653001203401653001103413653003603424653001503460653002303475653001003498700013603508700015503644700014003799700015503939700013804094700016404232700014604396773012904542787003304671787001804704787002104722856008404743912001204827914004004839914003404879916001504913917001104928918003604939935002204975949001504997953009105012954006105103955003505164961001305199974001705212983001505229984001505244991627933470742620221207101657.0190628e20190720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063940242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2019.04.0212chorus7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2019.04.0212doi  aagid:6394024-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, YongeauthoruDepartment of Ecosystem Science and Management, Texas A&M University, 2138 TAMU, College Station, TX 77843, USA10aSimulating the impacts of climate change on hydrology and crop production in the Northern High Plains of Texas using an improved SWAT model  ap. 13-24.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aModeling the effects of climate change on hydrology and crop yield provides opportunities for choosing appropriate crops for adapting to climate change. In this study, climate change impacts on irrigated corn and sorghum, dryland (rainfed) sorghum, and continuous fallow in the Northern High Plains of Texas were evaluated using an improved Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model equipped with management allowed depletion (MAD) irrigation scheduling. Projected climate data (2020–2099) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) of 19 General Circulation Models (GCMs) were used. Climate data were divided into four 20-year periods of near future (2020–2039), middle (2040–2059), late (2060–2079), and end (2080–2099) of the 21st century under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). For irrigated corn, median annual crop evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation decreased by 8%–25% and 15%–42%, respectively, under the climate change scenarios compared to the historical period (2001–2010). The median yield was reduced by 3%–22% with exponentially decreases in the latter half of the 21st century. For sorghum, the reduction of median annual crop ET ranged from 6%–27%. However, the decline in the median annual irrigation was within 15%, except for the 2060–2079 and 2080–2099 periods under RCP 8.5 scenarios with 30% and 49% reductions in median annual irrigation. The median irrigated sorghum yield declined by 6%–42%. The median annual crop ET of dryland sorghum decreased by 10%–16%. The reduction in median yield was within 10% of the historical dryland sorghum yield. The decrease in median annual evaporation varied from 15%–23% under future continuous fallow conditions. The elevated CO2 level of future climate scenarios was the primary factor for the decrease in the ET and irrigation. The reduction in future crop yield was mainly attributed to the shortening of the maturity period caused by increased future temperature.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cKansas State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007765  cTexas AgriLife Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100004913  cTexas Tech Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007131  cWest Texas A and M Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000108620 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aannuals 3aarid lands 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3afallow 3airrigation scheduling 3ameteorological data 3atemperature 3aTexas 0aDryland 0aFallow 0aGeneral circulation model (GCM) 0aIrrigation 0aEvapotranspiration 0aYield1 aMarek, Gary W.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, 300 Simmons Rd., Unit 10, Bushland, TX 79012, USA1 aMarek, Thomas H.eauthoruTexas A&M AgriLife Research, Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center, 6500 Amarillo Blvd W, Amarillo, TX 79106, USA1 aMoorhead, Jerry E.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, 300 Simmons Rd., Unit 10, Bushland, TX 79012, USA1 aHeflin, Kevin R.eauthoruTexas A&M AgriLife Research, Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center, 6500 Amarillo Blvd W, Amarillo, TX 79106, USA1 aBrauer, David K.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, 300 Simmons Rd., Unit 10, Bushland, TX 79012, USA1 aGowda, Prasanna H.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Grazinglands Research Laboratory, 7207 West Cheyenne Street, El Reno, OK 73036, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8782-69531 aSrinivasan, RaghavaneauthoruDepartment of Ecosystem Science and Management, Texas A&M University, 2138 TAMU, College Station, TX 77843, USA0 tAgricultural water management.g2019 July 20, v. 221 p.13-24dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774c221e13  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:2220  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6063940249ExL  a2019-06-28  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/712145934596777880-00003-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0378377418317980.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6394024  a2019-06-28  a2022-10-0403837nab a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004200098035002800140040001800168100016900186245013300355300001600488500025600504520159900760593001802359593001802377595005602395650002002451650001902471650001102490650001402501650002602515650001402541650001202555650001102567650001402578650001302592650001802605700017302623773013702796787003302933787001802966787002202984856005503006912001203061914002103073914002303094916001503117917001103132935002203143949001503165961000903180962004703189974001703236983001503253984001503268991628572540742620221118080913.0200615s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069867492DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1257.252doi  aagid:6986749-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarko, N.eauthoruFSFIS ‘The Labor Red Banner Order Nikitsky Botanical  Gardens - National Scientific Center of the RAS’, 298648, Nikita, Yalta, Crimea, Russia10aPhenological response to the climate change of oil-bearing rose under subtropical conditions of the southern coast of the Crimea  ap. 175-182.  aPaper presented at the XXX International Horticultural Congress IHC2018: International Symposium on Tropical and Subtropical Vegetable Production: Tackling Present and Future Global Biotic and Abiotic Stressors held August 12-16, 2018 Istanbul, Turkey  aTemperature is a critical cue for most rose species and some cultivars to bloom as they have an obligate vernalization requirement for flowering. Optimization of rose flower yield requires the ability to predict the response of plants to various environmental conditions, particularly air temperature. The aim of the present study was analyzed the quantitative response for the beginning of oil-bearing rose blossom to temperature. Three phenological models were examined with respect to their suitability to estimate possible shifts in the timing terms blossom of oil-bearing rose due to climate change. One of the approach was pure forcing model (F) and the remaining two models were combined parallel and sequential chilling-forcing (CF) models. The starting date of temperature accumulation, base temperature and the forcing requirements were optimized on the basis of observed data. The starting date of the models was set to 1 November (CF) and 1 January (F). Phenological observations and temperature data in the period 1968-2017 were used to fit these models. Root mean square errors (RMSE) between modeled and observed oil-bearing rose blossom data varied from 4.9 to 6.2 days. The percentages of variance explained by the flowering models were mean from 62 to 89%. The present study showed that the beginning of rose's blossom has moved forward since 1968 due to climate change slightly (average 2-3 days) however average air temperature during flowering since 2000 increased by 0.9 degrees. This study was funded by a research grant Nº 14-50-00079 of the Russian Science Foundation.  aPubAg article  dKeyed article  a555balice.allenc2020-06-18damanda.xue2020-06-27 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acultivars 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowering 3aflowers 3amodels 3aphenology 3avariance 3avernalization1 aKorsakova, S.eauthoruFSFIS ‘The Labor Red Banner Order Nikitsky Botanical  Gardens - National Scientific Center of the RAS’, 298648, Nikita, Yalta, Crimea, Russia0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1257 p.175-182dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4628940uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1257.25  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46289  fActa horticulturae  aBatch:2621  aissued  aIND6069867499ExL  a2020-12-04  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 2406-6168  aagid:6986749  a2020-06-15  a2020-12-0403764nab a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100016200182245011400344300001600458520124900474592002801723593001801751650001201769650001301781650002201794650001901816650001801835650001501853650001001868650001001878650001101888650001901899650001501918651003001933651001801963653003101981653001702012653001902029653002602048653001602074700020002090773016402290787003302454787001802487787001902505856008402524912001202608914004102620914002002661916001502681917001102696918002702707935002202734949001502756953006502771954006302836955003502899961001302934962004802947962004802995974001703043983001503060984001503075991628589890742620221118080714.0180514e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059444262DNAL7 a10.25225/fozo.v64.i3.a4.20152doi  aagid:5944426-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalbreath, Kurt E.eauthoruDepartment of Biology, Northern Michigan University, 1401 Presque Isle Ave, Marquette, MI 49855, U.S.A.; e-mail: kgalbrea@nmu.edu10aHost responses to cycles of climate change shape parasite diversity across North America's Intermountain West  ap. 218-232.  aHost-parasite cospeciation, in which parasite divergence occurs in response to host divergence, is commonly proposed as a driver of parasite diversification, yet few empirical examples of strict cospeciation exist. Host-parasite co-evolutionary histories commonly reflect complex mosaics of cospeciation, dispersal, lineage extinction and other phenomena. The episodic host-switching model of parasite diversification accounts for complexity by suggesting that diversification and faunal assembly is a consequence of fluctuation between environmental disruption and environmental stability. The phylogeographic predictions of the strict cospeciation and episodic host-switching models were tested using the North American pika/parasite assemblage, with a primary focus on the American pika, Ochotona princeps (Richardson, 1828), and a suite of its endoparasitic cestodes and nematodes. This approach integrating phylogeographic and demographic methods with inferences drawn from species distribution modelling revealed that the parasite community of pikas has been shaped by climate-driven range fluctuation of hosts and bouts of geographic and host colonization by parasites associated with transitions between glacial and interglacial phases.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aCestoda 3aNematoda 3aOchotona princeps 3aclimate change 3aendoparasites 3aextinction 3afauna 3ahosts 3amodels 3aphylogeography 3aprediction 3aIntermountain West region 3aNorth America 0acomparative phylogeography 0aco-evolution 0ahost-switching 0ahistorical demography 0aPleistocene1 aHoberg, Eric P.eauthoruUnited States National Parasite Collection, ARS USDA, Animal Parasitic Diseases Laboratory, BARC East 1180, Beltsville, MD 20705, U.S.A.; e-mail: eric.hoberg@ars.usda.gov0 tFolia zoologica.g2015 Nov., v. 64, no. 3 p.218-232dInstitute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech RepublicwJournal:14572x0139-78937nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1457240uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.25225/fozo.v64.i3.a4.20153Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:14572b0139-7893c64d3e218  fFolia zoologica  aBatch:2210  aissued2 aBioOneeprovider5DNAL  aIND6059444269ExL  a2019-10-16  a/data/metadata/incoming/bioone/FOZOv64i3-01020706-827432.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/bioone/fozo.v64.i3.a4.2015.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/bioone/  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:2210 reviewed on 2019-06-05T14:00:03Z  aBatch:2210 reviewed on 2019-10-16T15:00:03Z  aagid:5944426  a2018-05-14  a2019-10-1604497nab a2200937 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004200097024002100139035002600160040001800186072000900204072000900213072000900222072000900231072000900240100002200249245012500271300001600396500002400412500001500436520162400451593001802075593002002093650001102113650002502124650001802149650001802167650001902185650002202204650001702226650003402243650001002277650001902287650001802306650001602324650002102340650001502361650001302376650001802389650002602407650002402433650002502457651001202482653001602494653003002510653002602540653001802566653001302584653003202597653001802629700001502647700001802662700001602680700001702696700001702713773010702730787001802837787003302855787003002888787002202918852000902940856011202949856009203061912001203153914004403165914002603209917001103235930003303246935002103279945002503300946001103325949001503336952005103351961001203402974001503414984001503429985010303444986001203547991628630670742620221118085232.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441588052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01659.x2doi7 a10113/408742hdl  aagid:40874-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aB200 0aX100 0aJ500 0aJ1001 aSmithwick, E.A.H.10aModeling the effects of fire and climate change on carbon and nitrogen storage in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands  ap. 535-548.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe interaction between disturbance and climate change and resultant effects on ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes are poorly understood. Here, we model (using CENTURY version 4.5) how climate change may affect C and N fluxes among mature and regenerating lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Wats.) stands that vary in postfire tree density following stand-replacing fire. Both young (postfire) and mature stands had elevated forest production and net N mineralization under future climate scenarios relative to current climate. Forest production increased 25% [Hadley (HAD)] to 36% [Canadian Climate Center (CCC)], compared with 2% under current climate, among stands that varied in stand age and postfire density. Net N mineralization increased under both climate scenarios, e.g., +19% to 37% (HAD) and +11% to 23% (CCC), with greatest increases for young stands with sparse tree regeneration. By 2100, total ecosystem carbon (live+dead+soils) in mature stands was higher than prefire levels, e.g., +16% to 19% (HAD) and +24% to 28% (CCC). For stands regenerating following fire in 1988, total C storage was 0-9% higher under the CCC climate model, but 5-6% lower under the HAD model and 20-37% lower under the Control. These patterns, which reflect variation in stand age, postfire tree density, and climate model, suggest that although there were strong positive responses of lodgepole pine productivity to future changes in climate, C flux over the next century will reflect complex relationships between climate, age structure, and disturbance-recovery patterns of the landscape.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aforest growth 3aforest stands 3amineralization 3asimulation models 3aforest trees 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3afires 3aclimate change 3astand density 3atemperature 3aclimatic factors 3aprediction 3anitrogen 3aage structure 3anutrient availability 3aforest regeneration 3aglobal carbon budget 3aWyoming 0acarbon flux 0aYellowstone National Park 0abiogeochemical cycles 0aprecipitation 0aserotiny 0aforest-atmosphere relations 0aCENTURY model1 aRyan, M.G.1 aKashian, D.M.1 aRomme, W.H.1 aTinker, D.B.1 aTurner, M.G.0 tGlobal change biology.g2009 Mar., v.  15, no.  3 p.535-548dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl57021  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/408743Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01659.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c15d3e535  fGlobal change biology  aissued  a20100426b20100501c00000000  aIND441588059ExL  aINDdLYNe2010/04/26  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20100426 20100501 00000000bIND LYN 2010/04/26  aUSDA/FS  aagid:40874  a2010-05-01  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a415880505774nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100015400171245010100325300001800426500002000444520238200464592002802846593001802874650001402892650001602906650001102922650001202933650001902945650001902964650001302983650002202996650001903018650005003037650001303087650001103100650001603111650001503127651002103142651001903163651001903182651001203201651001503213651001103228651000903239651002303248700013503271700013503406700013503541700013703676700013103813700017303944700013504117700013704252773013204389787003304521787001804554787002204572856007304594912001204667914004504679914002804724916001504752917001104767918004304778935002204821949001504843953002704858961001204885962004804897974001704945983001504962984001504977991628745980742620221118101452.0180102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058760462DNAL7 a10.1890/10-2206.12doi  aagid:5876046-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKelvey, Kevin S.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, 800 East Beckwith, Missoula, Montana 59801 USA. kmckelvey@fs.fed.us10aClimate change predicted to shift wolverine distributions, connectivity, and dispersal corridors  ap. 2882-2897.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBoreal species sensitive to the timing and duration of snow cover are particularly vulnerable to global climate change. Recent work has shown a link between wolverine (Gulo gulo) habitat and persistent spring snow cover through 15 May, the approximate end of the wolverine's reproductive denning period. We modeled the distribution of snow cover within the Columbia, Upper Missouri, and Upper Colorado River Basins using a downscaled ensemble climate model. The ensemble model was based on the arithmetic mean of 10 global climate models (GCMs) that best fit historical climate trends and patterns within these three basins. Snow cover was estimated from resulting downscaled temperature and precipitation patterns using a hydrologic model. We bracketed our ensemble model predictions by analyzing warm (miroc 3.2) and cool (pcm1) downscaled GCMs. Because Moderate‐Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)‐based snow cover relationships were analyzed at much finer grain than downscaled GCM output, we conducted a second analysis based on MODIS‐based snow cover that persisted through 29 May, simulating the onset of spring two weeks earlier in the year. Based on the downscaled ensemble model, 67% of predicted spring snow cover will persist within the study area through 2030–2059, and 37% through 2070–2099. Estimated snow cover for the ensemble model during the period 2070–2099 was similar to persistent MODIS snow cover through 29 May. Losses in snow cover were greatest at the southern periphery of the study area (Oregon, Utah, and New Mexico, USA) and least in British Columbia, Canada. Contiguous areas of spring snow cover become smaller and more isolated over time, but large (>1000 km²) contiguous areas of wolverine habitat are predicted to persist within the study area throughout the 21st century for all projections. Areas that retain snow cover throughout the 21st century are British Columbia, north‐central Washington, northwestern Montana, and the Greater Yellowstone Area. By the late 21st century, dispersal modeling indicates that habitat isolation at or above levels associated with genetic isolation of wolverine populations becomes widespread. Overall, we expect wolverine habitat to persist throughout the species range at least for the first half of the 21st century, but populations will likely become smaller and more isolated.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aGulo gulo 3aarithmetics 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3ahabitats 3ahydrologic models 3aimage analysis 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3asnowpack 3aspring 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aBritish Columbia 3aColorado River 3aMissouri River 3aMontana 3aNew Mexico 3aOregon 3aUtah 3aWashington (state)1 aCopeland, Jeffrey P.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, 800 East Beckwith, Missoula, Montana 59801 USA1 aSchwartz, Michael K.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, 800 East Beckwith, Missoula, Montana 59801 USA1 aLittell, Jeremy S.eauthoruUniversity of Washington Climate Impacts Group, 3737 Brooklyn Avenue NE, Seattle, Washington 98105 USA1 aAubry, Keith B.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3625 93rd Avenue SW, Olympia, Washington 98512 USA1 aSquires, John R.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, 800 East Beckwith, Missoula, Montana 59801 USA1 aParks, Sean A.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, 790 East Beckwith, Missoula, Montana 59801 USA1 aElsner, Marketa M.eauthoruUniversity of Washington Climate Impacts Group, 3737 Brooklyn Avenue NE, Seattle, Washington 98105 USA1 aMauger, Guillaume S.eauthoruUniversity of Washington Climate Impacts Group, 3737 Brooklyn Avenue NE, Seattle, Washington 98105 USA0 tEcological applications.g2011 Dec., v. 21, no. 8 p.2882-2897dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4719340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-2206.13Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl47193b1051-0761c21d8e2882  fEcological applications  aBatch:1910  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058760469ExL  a2018-02-28  a10510761_2011_21_8.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1910 reviewed on 2018-02-28T15:00:02Z  aagid:5876046  a2018-01-02  a2018-02-2805396nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003800097035002700135040001800162100015100180245012700331300001800458500001500476520205500491592002802546593001802574650001402592650001302606650001202619650001002631650001102641650001202652650001202664650001902676650001202695650000902707650001402716650001902730650001602749650000902765650001302774650002102787650002302808650001502831650001202846650002002858650002202878650001302900651001802913653001502931700014102946700014803087700014203235700015303377700015103530700015903681700014103840773010703981787003304088787001804121787002104139856008404160912001204244914004504256914003404301917001104335918003404346935002104380949001504401953003304416961001204449962004804461962004704509974001604556983001504572984001504587991628919420742620221118122430.0141111e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND605396332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.12.0402doi  aagid:539633-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChmura, Daniel J.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University, 321 Richardson Hall Corvallis, OR 97331-5752, USA10aForest responses to climate change in the northwestern United States: Ecophysiological foundations for adaptive management  ap. 1121-1142.  a2019-12-06  aClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide ([COâ]) is expected to result in warmer temperatures and changed precipitation regimes during this century. In the northwestern U.S., these changes will likely decrease snowpack, cause earlier snowmelt, increase summer evapotranspiration, and increase the frequency and severity of droughts. Elevated [COâ] and warmer temperatures may have positive effects on growth and productivity where there is adequate moisture or growth is currently limited by cold. However, the effects of climate change are generally expected to reduce growth and survival, predispose forests to disturbance by wildfire, insects, and disease; and ultimately change forest structure and composition at the landscape scale. Substantial warming will likely decrease winter chilling resulting in delayed bud burst, and adversely affect flowering and seed germination for some species. The extent of these effects will depend on the magnitude of climate change, the abilities of individual trees to acclimate, and for tree populations to adapt in situ, or to migrate to suitable habitats. These coping mechanisms may be insufficient to maintain optimal fitness of tree populations to rapidly changing climate. Physiological responses to climatic stresses are relatively well-understood at the organ or whole-plant scale but not at the stand or landscape scale. In particular, the interactive effects of multiple stressors is not well known. Genetic and silvicultural approaches to increase adaptive capacities and to decrease climate-related vulnerabilities of forests can be based on ecophysiological knowledge. Effective approaches to climate adaptation will likely include assisted migration of species and populations, and density management. Use of these approaches to increase forest resistance and resilience at the landscape scale requires a better understanding of species adaptations, within-species genetic variation, and the mitigating effects of silvicultural treatments.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aflowering 3asnowpack 3adrought 3atrees 3asummer 3ainsects 3aforests 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3abuds 3awildfires 3aclimate change 3atemperature 3acold 3asnowmelt 3aseed germination 3aevapotranspiration 3alandscapes 3acooling 3astress response 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3aUnited States 0aadaptation1 aAnderson, Paul D.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331-4401, USA1 aHowe, Glenn T.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University, 321 Richardson Hall Corvallis, OR 97331-5752, USA1 aHarrington, Constance A.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3625 93rd Ave. SW, Olympia, WA 98512-1101, USA1 aHalofsky, Jessica E.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Wildland Fire Sciences Laboratory, 400N. 34th St., Suite 201, Seattle, WA 98103-8600, USA1 aPeterson, David L.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Wildland Fire Sciences Laboratory, 400N. 34th St., Suite 201, Seattle, WA 98103-8600, USA1 aShaw, David C.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Engineering, Resources and Management, Oregon State University, 204 Peavy Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331-5752, USA1 aBrad St.Clair, J.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331-4401, USA0 tForest ecology and management.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 261, no. 7 p.1121-1142dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl901340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl9013b0378-1127c261d7e1121  fForest ecology and management  aissued2 aElsevier B.V.eprovider5DNAL  aIND605396339ExL  a2013-09-26  aNAL270800378112702610007.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:347 annotated on 2013-09-04T16:33:53Z  aBatch:347 reviewed on 2013-09-26T16:00:02Z  aagid:539633  a2014-11-11  a2014-11-1102797nab a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098035002800137040001800165100010800183245012200291300001600413520100300429592002801432593001801460650001901478650001201497650001901509650002201528650001101550650002501561653001501586653001901601653002001620773011401640787003301754787001801787787001901805856008501824912001201909914004001921914005001961916001502011917001102026918004302037935002202080949001502102953005402117961001302171962004802184974001702232983001502249984001502264991629332790742620221118071343.0160420e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051904162DNAL7 a10.1080/21606544.2015.10759062doi  aagid:5190416-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNigatu, GetacheweauthoruEconomic Research Service (ERS/USDA), 355 E Street SW, Washington DC20024,USA10aAssessing the effects of climate change policy on the volatility of carbon prices in reference to the Great Recession  ap. 200-215.  aThis paper examines the effects of having or not having a climate change policy on the behaviour of carbon price volatility before, within and after the 2008/09 global recession. Our Markov-regime switching model analysis shows that the voluntary carbon market at the Chicago Climate Exchange was in a high-volatile regime within, and two years before, this recession. The mandatory carbon market in the European Climate Exchange was relatively in stable and low-volatile regime over these periods, except at the end of the recession. The voluntary market exhibited more price volatility features than the mandatory one. After the recession, both markets experienced high probabilities of being at low-volatile regimes. Our results suggest that high-volatile regimes were not caused by the recession per se. However, statistical tests show that there were distinct low-and high-volatile regimes during the recession period, indicating that the recession aggravated price volatility of both markets.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acarbon markets 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aissues and policy 3aprices 3astatistical analysis 0avolatility 0acarbon markets 0aGreat Recession0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Policy.g2016 May 3, v. 5, no. 2 p.200-215dRoutledgex2160-65527nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1968540uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21606544.2015.10759063Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:19685b2160-6552c5d2e200  fJournal of Environmental Economics and Policy  aBatch:1457  aissued2 aTaylor & Francis Groupeprovider5DNAL  aIND6051904169ExL  a2016-11-16  ateep20_teep20.v005.i02_20160420114836#7834257.zip  aUSDA/ERS  aBatch:1457 reviewed on 2016-11-16T04:00:02Z  aagid:5190416  a2016-04-20  a2016-11-1605585nab a2200925 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098024004200137035002800179040001800207100014500225245007300370300001600443506007600459506003100535520214700566592002802713593001802741596004402759596004602803596008802849506003702937650001802974650001502992650004103007650001603048650002403064650002303088650001203111650001903123650001903142650002803161650001203189650000903201650001603210650001103226650002103237650001903258650002403277650000903301650001603310650001203326650002203338650001503360651001303375653001803388653002503406653000903431653002203440653001603462653002303478700015103501700010803652700010503760773011403865787003303979787001804012787001804030856008604048856004504134912001204179914003704191914002604228916001504254917001104269918003604280935002204316949001504338953007004353954007104423955004504494961000904539962004704548962001704595974001704612983001504629984001504644991629467570742620221215142348.0190412e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052488512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.04.0022doi7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.04.0022chorus  aagid:5248851-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoznicki, Sean A.eauthoruDepartment of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States10aLarge-scale climate change vulnerability assessment of stream health  ap. 578-594.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFreshwater streams are critical resources that provide multiple benefits to humans and aquatic biota alike. As climate changes, it is projected that changes to the hydrological cycle and water temperatures will affect individual biota and aquatic ecosystems as a whole. The goal of this study was to determine the extent of climate change impacts on stream ecosystems as represented by four commonly used stream health indicators (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPT), Family Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI), Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), and fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI)). Seven watersheds in Michigan were selected based on stream thermal regimes. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to simulate streamflow and pollutant loads. Important variables for each thermal class were selected using a Bayesian variable selection method and used as inputs to adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems models of EPT, FIBI, HBI, and IBI. Finally, an ensemble of climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 were used to determine the impacts of climate on the stream health in 2020–2040 compared to 1980–2000. The risk of declining stream health was determined using cumulative distribution functions. A stream temperature regression model was also developed to assess potential changes in stream thermal regimes, which could cause shifts in composition of aquatic communities. Several flow regime variables, including those related to flow variability, duration of extreme events, and timing were mainly affected by changing climate. At the watershed scale, most indicators were relatively insensitive to changing climate and the magnitude of stream health decline was low. However, at the reach scale, there are many instances of high risk and large magnitude of declines in the stream health indicators. At the same time, several streams experienced changes in thermal class, mostly transitioning from cold-transitional and cool streams to warm streams. This research demonstrated the applicability of the stream health modeling process in performing a climate change impacts assessment.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDOEdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000015  cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEphemeroptera 3aPlecoptera 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aTrichoptera 3aaquatic communities 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acumulative distribution 3adecline 3afish 3afuzzy logic 3ahumans 3ahydrologic cycle 3apollution load 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3astream flow 3astreams 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3aMichigan 0aStream health 0aBiological integrity 0aFish 0aMacroinvertebrate 0aFuzzy logic 0aStream temperature1 aNejadhashemi, A.

With population growth and the need to significantly increase agricultural production per unit of area during the 21st century, a changing climate will put additional stress on soil resources. Soil and water conservation will be key for the future of humanity. Professional societies in the area of agriculture and soil and water conservation have recognized the importance that soil resources will have for humanity during this century and have made calls for implementation of worldwide soil and water conservation. For example, in 2010 the Soil and Water Conservation Society (SWCS) invited a group of scientists to review the literature about the potential to use conservation practices for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The Delgado et al. (2011) paper was used by the SWCS to develop and adopt a position statement about the importance of using soil and water conservation practices to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The International Soil Conservation Organization (ISCO) invited the lead author to present the paper as a keynote presentation at the ISCO 2013 conference. The European Society of Soil Conservation (ESSC) published a short communication about this paper in one of their newsletters in 2014. The World Association of Soil and Water Conservation (WASWAC) also invited the lead author to present a keynote presentation on this topic at the 2015 WASWAC annual meeting in Nanchang. This paper (the Nanchang Communication) is a summary of the Delgado et al. (2011) paper that was used by the SWCS to develop the SWCS position statement related to soil and water conservation and climate change. The Nanchang Communication (this paper) was used by WASWAC to develop a position statement about the immediate need for implementation of conservation practices for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change to achieve food security in the 21st century. These papers (Delgado et al., 2011, Nanchang Communication), and the SWCS and WASWAC position statements, support the conclusions from the worldwide literature that without implementation of soil and water conservation practices for climate change mitigation and adaptation, the survival of life, including our own species, will be in jeopardy, since soils will be key to meeting the higher demands for food during the 21st century.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3aconservation practices 3afood security 3apopulation growth 3ascientists 3asoil 3asoil conservation 3asoil resources 3awater conservation 0aFood security 0aConservation practice 0aClimate change 0aWASWAC 0aSWCS1 aLi, RuieauthoruInstitute of Soil and Water Conservation, Northwest Scie-technology University of Agriculture and Forestry, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, PR China0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2016 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.148-150dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power PresswJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2324640uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iswcr.2016.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:23246b2095-6339c4e148  fInternational soil and water conservation research  aBatch:1722  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6052489439ExL  a2019-04-16  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00112-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S2095633916300557.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:5248943  a2019-04-16  a2019-04-1605930nab a2200805 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098035002800137040001800165100016700183245010400350300001600454520250300470592002802973593001803001650002403019650002403043650001203067650001103079650001903090650001703109650001203126650001903138650002403157650001703181650001203198650003903210650002303249650001003272650001703282650001803299650001003317650001703327650001503344651001303359653001003372653002903382653002003411653002703431653001703458653002703475700016103502700016403663700012303827700016803950700016504118700016304283773012304446787003304569787001804602787002004620856008604640912001204726914004004738914003204778916001504810917001104825918003604836935002204872949001504894953006004909954006104969955003505030961001205065974001705077983001505094984001505109991630110130742620221118065613.0190318e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058146572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.08.0282doi  aagid:5814657-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosier, Samantha L.eauthoruMichigan Technological University, School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI 49931, USA10aInteractive effects of climate change and fungal communities on wood-derived carbon in forest soils  ap. 297-309.  aAlthough wood makes up the majority of forest biomass, the importance of wood contributions to stable soil carbon (C) pools is uncertain. Complex interactions among climate, soil physical properties, intrinsic properties of woody residues, and biological processes all exert dynamic controls over the stabilization, destabilization and transport of wood-derived C in soils. Many studies have demonstrated the strong physical controls on decomposition rates in soils, but little work has been done to relate these to changes in decomposer community composition and how this influences the fate of wood-derived C in soils. Here, we examine the effects of initial fungal inoculation, temperature, soil texture, Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) wood type, and location of wood residue in the soil, with an experiment investigating the fate of wood-derived C from soils in the first two years following clear-cut harvest in aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forests. We applied 13C-depleted aspen wood chips in 168 experimental plots across six sites in northern Michigan, USA, and tracked the depleted 13C signature through the mineral soil as DOC and from the soil surface as CO2.Wood residue location had the largest impact on soil CO2 efflux, with surface wood treatments having more than twice as much wood-derived soil CO2 efflux as buried wood treatments (1.20 g CO2 m−2 h−1 versus 0.49 g CO2 m−2 h−1, respectively; p < 0.001). Initial fungal decomposers had a significant effect on DOC quantity and quality, with higher wood-derived DOC concentrations, levels of humification, and tannin content for white-rot treatments compared with brown-rot treatments. Buried chip treatments within open-top chambers had one-third higher wood-derived soil CO2 efflux than buried chips in ambient temperature treatments (p < 0.002). FACE wood type also influenced soil C fluxes from the decomposing wood chips. The average wood-derived soil CO2 efflux and the average percentage of wood-derived soil CO2 efflux were significantly greater from wood grown under elevated CO2 than wood grown under elevated CO2 + O3 (p = 0.002 and p = 0.004, respectively). Furthermore, wood grown under elevated CO2 had increased DOC aromaticity relative to wood grown in ambient conditions. Taken together, these results show that wood-derived C sources and the decomposers that process them are significant determinants of C fluxes from and transformations within the soil following harvest in aspen forests.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aambient temperature 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclearcutting 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3adecayed wood 3aforests 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3afungal communities 3afungi 3ahumification 3amineral soils 3aozone 3asoil texture 3awood chips 3aMichigan 0aAspen 0aDissolved organic carbon 0aSoil CO2 efflux 0aStable carbon isotopes 0aWood residue 0aWood decomposing fungi1 aKane, Evan S.eauthoruMichigan Technological University, School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI 49931, USA1 aRichter, Dana L.eauthoruMichigan Technological University, School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI 49931, USA1 aLilleskov, Erik A.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, 410 MacInnes Drive, Houghton, MI 49931, USA1 aJurgensen, Martin F.eauthoruMichigan Technological University, School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI 49931, USA1 aBurton, Andrew J.eauthoruMichigan Technological University, School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI 49931, USA1 aResh, Sigrid C.eauthoruMichigan Technological University, School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI 49931, USA0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 115 p.297-309dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl12440uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.08.0283Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl124b0038-0717c115e297  fSoil biology & biochemistry  aBatch:1851  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6058146579ExL  a2019-03-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00018-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0038071717300275.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:5814657  a2019-03-18  a2019-03-1803039nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098035002800137040001800165100014900183245012400332300001600456520076800472592002801240593001801268650001201286650001901298650000901317650001601326650001501342650001301357650001301370650002201383650001601405650001901421651001301440653002601453653002401479653001601503653001301519700010601532773011101638787003301749787001801782787002401800856008601824912001201910914004601922914002401968916001501992917001102007918004302018935002202061949001502083953009302098954007202191955004202263961001302305962004802318974001702366983001502383984001502398991630222620742620221118075030.0181214e20180818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061620922DNAL7 a10.1080/02508060.2018.15155682doi  aagid:6162092-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Timothy R.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Center for Agricultural Resources Research, Water Management & Systems Research Unit, Fort Collins, CO, USA10aIrrigation variability and climate change affect derived distributions of simulated water recharge and nitrate leaching  ap. 829-845.  aIrrigation (‘blue’) water has high value as municipalities seek water security under growing populations and projected climates, but spatial variability makes estimating return flows to groundwater challenging. We demonstrate a framework for simulating spatially variable infiltration and derived distributions of return flows using an agricultural and vadose zone model to simulate recharge and nitrate leaching under irrigated corn in semi-arid northeastern Colorado, USA. Derived distributions indicated increased historical recharge (2–42%) as the spatial variability of applied irrigation increased. Projected climate in 2050 increased recharge above historical rates by up to 58%, but climatic effects decreased with increasing irrigation variability.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3aleaching 3anitrates 3asimulation models 3avadose zone 3awater security 3aColorado 0aIrrigation efficiency 0aspatial variability 0agroundwater 0aColorado1 aAnapalli, Saseendran S.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Crop Production Systems Research Unit, Stoneville, MS, USA0 tWater international.g2018 Aug. 18, v. 43, no. 6 p.829-845dRoutledgewJournal:J000000164x1941-17077nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)J00000016440uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02508060.2018.15155683Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:J000000164b1941-1707c43d6e829  fWater international  aBatch:2104  aissued2 aTaylor & Francis Groupeprovider5DNAL  aIND6061620929ExL  a2019-02-08  a/data/metadata/incoming/taylorfrancis/rwin20_rwin20.v043.i06_20181214180923#15412421.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/taylorfrancis/02508060.2018.1515568.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/taylorfrancis/  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:2104 reviewed on 2019-02-08T09:00:02Z  aagid:6162092  a2018-12-14  a2019-02-0804151nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003100097024002100128035002600149040001800175072000900193072000900202072000900211072000900220100002800229245010600257300001600363500001500379520158300394592002801977593001802005593002002023650003002043650001702073650001102090650002302101650001002124650001902134650001202153650001002165650002702175650002102202650001802223650001302241651001102254651001002265651003102275651001502306700003202321700003202353700003202385700002802417773012702445787001802572787003302590787003002623787002402653852000902677856011202686856008102798912001202879914005102891914004202942917001102984918002702995930003303022935002103055945002503076949001503101952005103116953003303167961001203200974001503212984001503227985010303242986001203345991630474880742620221118112054.0091020e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442758842DNAL7 a10.1614/IPSM-08-120.12doi7 a10113/371642hdl  aagid:37164-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aP010 0aF300 0aB2001 aKerns, Becky K.eauthor10aModeling Tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) Habitat and Climate Change Effects in the Northwestern United States  ap. 200-215.  a2019-12-05  aTamarisk species are shrubs or small trees considered by some to be among the most aggressively invasive and potentially detrimental exotic plants in the United States. Although extensively studied in the southern and interior west, northwestern (Oregon, Washington, and Idaho) distribution and habitat information for tamarisk is either limited or lacking. We obtained distribution data for the northwest, developed a habitat suitability map, and projected changes in habitat due to climate change in a smaller case study area using downscaled climate data. Results show extensive populations of tamarisk east of the Cascade Mountains. Despite the perceived novelty of tamarisk in the region, naturalized populations were present by the 1920s. Major population centers are limited to the warmest and driest environments in the central Snake River Plain, Columbia Plateau, and Northern Basin and Range. Habitat suitability model results indicate that 21%% of the region supports suitable tamarisk habitat. Less than 1%% of these areas are occupied by tamarisk; the remainder is highly vulnerable to invasion. Although considerable uncertainty exists regarding future climate change, we project a 2- to 10-fold increase in highly suitable tamarisk habitat by the end of the century. Our habitat suitability maps can be used in ““what if”” exercises as part of planning, detection, restoration, management, and eradication purposes.Nomenclature: Tamarisk, species in the genus Tamarix L., primarily Tamarix chinensis Lour. and Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. and their hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3ageographical distribution 3aweed control 3ashrubs 3aintroduced species 3atrees 3aclimate change 3aTamarix 3aweeds 3aecological restoration 3ainvasive species 3aplant ecology 3ahabitats 3aOregon 3aIdaho 0aNorthwestern United States 0aWashington1 aNaylor, Bridgett J.eauthor1 aBuonopane, Michelleeauthor1 aParks, Catherine G.eauthor1 aRogers, Brendaneauthor0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2009 July, v. 2, no. 3 p.200-215dWeed Science Society of Americax1939-747X7nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl4194316  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/371643Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614/IPSM-08-120.13Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4194316b1939-7291c2d3e200–215  fInvasive plant science and management  aissued2 aBioOneeprovider5DNAL  a20100104b20100205c00000000  aIND442758849ExL  aINDd9CTe2009/11/23  a2016-09-13  a20100104 20100205 00000000bIND 9CT 2009/11/23  aIPSMv2i3-04282014-172398.zip  aUSDA/FS  aagid:37164  a2018-05-25  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a427588403601nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002800097024002100125035002600146040001800172072000900190072000900199072000900208072000900217100001800226245010600244300001600350500002400366500002300390520127800413593001801691593002001709650001701729650002001746650002601766650001901792650002201811650001901833650001601852650002301868650002201891650002101913650001701934650002101951650002301972650002401995650001302019651003102032700001902063773007402082787001802156787003302174787003002207787001902237852000902256856007802265856011202343912001202455914004102467914002302508917001102531930003302542935002102575945002502596946001102621949001502632952005102647961001202698974001502710984001502725985010302740986001202843991630501490742620221118120613.0050801e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437290932DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc81369-32doi7 a10113/373212hdl  aagid:37321-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK250 0aB200 0aF300 0aX1001 aLittell, J.S.12aA method for estimating vulnerability of Douglas-fir growth to climate change in the northwestern U.S  ap. 369-374.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aBorrowing from landscape ecology, atmospheric science, and integrated assessment, we aim to understand the complex interactions that determine productivity in montane forests and utilize such relationships to forecast montane forest vulnerability under global climate change. Specifically, we identify relationships for precipitation and temperature that govern the spatiotemporal variability in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) growth by seeking similarities in patterns of growth/climate models across a significant portion of the climatological range of the species. In the 21st century and beyond, sustainable forestry will depend on successful adaptation to the impacts of climate change and climate variability on forest structure and function. The combination of these foci will allow improved prediction of the fate of montane forests over a wide range of biogeoclimatic conditions in western North America and thus allow improved management strategies for adapting to climate change. We describe a multi-disciplinary strategy for analyzing growth variability as a function of climate over a broad range of local-to-regional influences and demonstrate the efficacy of this sampling method in defining regional gradients of growth-limiting factors.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aforest trees 3amontane forests 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aglobal warming 3alandscape ecology 3aforest ecology 3atree growth 3atemporal variation 3aspatial variation 3aclimatic factors 3agrowth rings 3adendrochronology 3astatistical models 3aregression analysis 3asampling 3aNorthwestern United States1 aPeterson, D.L.0 tForestry chronicle.g2005 , v.  81, no.  3 p.369-374x0015-75467nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)12176  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc81369-33Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/373213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:12176b0015-7546c81d3e369  fForestry chronicle  aissued  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aIND437290939ExL  aINDdLYNe2006/06/28  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20100108 20100205 00000000bIND LYN 2006/06/28  aUSDA/FS  aagid:37321  a2011-11-03  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a372909305982nab a2200949 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100012300171245012500294500002000419520229000439592002802729593001802757596005902775596008102834596007702915596002202992596002903014596004403043650001603087650000803103650001203111650001803123650002203141650001603163650001603179650001903195650002303214650002103237650001403258650001503272650001303287650001203300650001303312650001403325650001803339650001503357650001903372650001403391650001203405650001503417650002603432650001303458650002103471650001303492650002103505650001203526650002203538650001103560650001103571651001803582700016603600700015403766700017303920700011504093700016604208773010704374787003304481787001804514787001904532856007404551912001204625914004404637914001404681916001604695917001104711918004304722935002204765949001504787952001904802953005704821954006104878955003404939961001204973974001704985983001505002984001505017991630936810742620221118071931.0220225e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076805882DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.38592doi  aagid:7680588-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlagden, MeganeauthoruDepartment of Biology, Boston University, 5 Cummington Mall, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA10aClimate change influences foliar nutrition and metabolism of red maple (Acer rubrum) trees in a northern hardwood forest  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMean annual air temperatures are projected to increase, while the winter snowpack is expected to shrink in depth and duration for many mid‐ and high‐latitude temperate forest ecosystems over the next several decades. Together, these changes will lead to warmer growing season soil temperatures and an increased frequency of soil freeze–thaw cycles (FTCs) in winter. We took advantage of the Climate Change Across Seasons Experiment (CCASE) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, USA, to determine how these changes in soil temperature affect foliar nitrogen (N) and carbon metabolism of red maple (Acer rubrum) trees in 2015 and 2017. Earlier work from this study revealed a similar increase in foliar N concentrations with growing season soil warming, with or without the occurrence of soil FTCs in winter. However, these changes in soil warming could differentially affect the availability of cellular nutrients, concentrations of primary and secondary metabolites, and the rates of photosynthesis that are all responsive to climate change. We found that foliar concentrations of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), N, spermine (a polyamine), amino acids (alanine, histidine, and phenylalanine), chlorophyll, carotenoids, sucrose, and rates of photosynthesis increased with growing season soil warming. Despite similar concentrations of foliar N with soil warming with and without soil FTCs in winter, winter soil FTCs affected other foliar metabolic responses. The combination of growing season soil warming and winter soil FTCs led to increased concentrations of two polyamines (putrescine and spermine) and amino acids (alanine, proline, aspartic acid, γ‐aminobutyric acid, valine, leucine, and isoleucine). Treatment‐specific metabolic changes indicated that while responses to growing season warming were more connected to their role as growth modulators, soil warming + FTC treatment‐related effects revealed their dual role in growth and stress tolerance. Together, the results of this study demonstrate that growing season soil warming has multiple positive effects on foliar N and cellular metabolism in trees and that some of these foliar responses are further modified by the addition of stress from winter soil FTCs.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aNSF DEB1149929cNSF CAREER grant to PHT Pamela Templer  aNSF 1114804cNSF Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Grant to Hubbard Brook  a1637685cNSF Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Grant to Hubbard Brook  cBoston University  cUSDA Forest Service, NRS  aDGE0947950cNational Science Foundation 3aAcer rubrum 3aair 3aalanine 3aaspartic acid 3acarbon metabolism 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ahardwood forests 3ahistidine 3aisoleucine 3alatitude 3aleucine 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aphenylalanine 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium 3aproline 3aputrescine 3asecondary metabolites 3asnowpack 3asoil temperature 3aspermine 3astress tolerance 3asucrose 3atemperate forests 3avaline 3awinter 3aNew Hampshire1 aHarrison, Jamie L.eauthoruDepartment of Biology, Boston University, 5 Cummington Mall, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7937-05031 aMinocha, RakesheauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northeastern Research Station, Durham, New Hampshire, 03824, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4055-51371 aSanders‐DeMott, RebeccaeauthoruDepartment of Biology, Boston University, 5 Cummington Mall, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0709-80421 aLong, StephanieeauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northeastern Research Station, Durham, New Hampshire, 03824, USA1 aTempler, Pamela H.eauthoruDepartment of Biology, Boston University, 5 Cummington Mall, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6570-38370 tEcosphere.g2022 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.e03859-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1236340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.38593Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:12363b2150-8925c13d2ee03859  fEcosphere  aBatch:10238  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6076805889ExL  a2022-06-03  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/21508925_2022_13_2.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/21508925_2022_13_2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7680588  a2022-02-25  a2022-06-0304918nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100014900171245011500320500002000435520211500455592002802570593001802598650002102616650002702637650001202664650001802676650001102694650002002705650001202725650001902737650001202756650001002768650002302778650001402801650001502815650001102830650001402841650001302855650001502868650001602883650001902899650001402918651000902932651001102941651002602952700014802978700014903126700010203275700012703377773010603504787003303610787001803643787001903661856007403680912001203754914004303766914001403809916001603823917001103839918004303850935002203893949001503915952001903930953005703949954006104006955003404067961001204101974001704113983001504130984001504145991630937070742620221118072017.0220225e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076805932DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.39172doi  aagid:7680593-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGustafson, Eric J.eauthoruInstitute for Applied Ecosystem Studies, USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Rhinelander, Wisconsin, USA10aBeyond blight: Phytophthora root rot under climate change limits populations of reintroduced American chestnut  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAmerican chestnut (Castanea dentata) was functionally extirpated from eastern US forests by chestnut blight, caused by a fungus from Asia. As efforts to produce blight‐resistant American chestnut germplasm advance, approaches to reintroduce chestnut throughout its former range are being developed. However, chestnut is also quite susceptible to a root disease in the southern half of its former range, and the pathogen that causes the disease (Phytophthora cinnamomi) is expected to move northward as climate warms. Genetic resistance to root rot appears to vary among individual chestnut trees, and the prevalence of resistance is highly uncertain. Because restoration of a self‐sustaining chestnut population is ultimately a landscape‐scale problem, we used a process‐based forest landscape model (LANDIS‐II) to conduct experiments to quantify the effects of root rot on the effectiveness of chestnut population restoration efforts in the center of the former range of chestnut under various climate scenarios. We developed a new LANDIS‐II extension to simulate root rot‐induced tree mortality as a function of temperature and soil moisture. We conducted a factorial simulation experiment with climate and resistance to root rot as factors and found that root rot greatly reduced chestnut biomass on the landscape, even when resistance to root rot infection was at the highest levels currently observed in published studies. Warming climate enhanced the virulence of the pathogen and resulted in a greater reduction in chestnut biomass. Results indicate that root rot has the potential to seriously hamper chestnut restoration efforts if resistance of chestnut is not enhanced through breeding and biotechnology, suggesting restoration efforts will be more successful if targeted to latitudes, elevations, and site conditions where root rot is not expected to be present well into the future, including areas north of the historical chestnut range (Canada). These results demonstrate the vital importance of incorporating root rot resistance into the larger blight resistance breeding program.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aCastanea dentata 3aPhytophthora cinnamomi 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3ablight 3achestnut blight 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aforests 3afungi 3agenetic resistance 3agermplasm 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apathogens 3aroot rot 3asoil water 3atemperature 3atree mortality 3avirulence 3aAsia 3aCanada 3aEastern United States1 aMiranda, Brian R.eauthoruInstitute for Applied Ecosystem Studies, USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Rhinelander, Wisconsin, USA1 aDreaden, Tyler J.eauthoruForest Health Research and Education Center, USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Lexington, Kentucky, USA1 aPinchot, Cornelia C.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Delaware, Ohio, USA1 aJacobs, Douglass F.eauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Natural Resources, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA0 tEcosphere.g2022 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.e3917-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1236340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.39173Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:12363b2150-8925c13d2ee3917  fEcosphere  aBatch:10238  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6076805939ExL  a2022-05-17  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/21508925_2022_13_2.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/21508925_2022_13_2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7680593  a2022-02-25  a2022-05-1707415nab a2200961 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100014600182245006600328500002200394520189200416592002802308593001802336650001502354650003002369650001202399650001902411650001802430650001502448650002302463650001902486650002102505650002202526650002402548650001202572650002202584650001602606650001002622650001602632650002402648650002502672651001402697651001102711651001002722651001202732653002102744653002302765653003002788653002302818653004502841653001902886700022002905700012703125700016203252700017903414700016603593700014503759700008603904700013503990700019204125700012004317700022104437700013304658700014604791700024904937700012305186700017805309700014205487700014105629773011105770787003305881787001805914787002105932856008505953912001206038914003906050914003406089917001106123918003606134935002206170949001506192953009106207954006106298955003506359961001206394974001706406983001506423984001506438991631286060742620221118120531.0220929e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079464122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2022.1205452doi  aagid:7946412-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, MingfangeauthoruSchool of Resources and Environment, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China10aManaging the Forest-Water Nexus for Climate Change Adaptation  aPre-press version  aClimate change can directly affect forest hydrology by altering precipitation, evapotranspiration, and streamflow generation, or indirectly by changing disturbance regimes and forest structures at multiple scales. Climate change impacts on the forest-water nexus across biomes are pervasive characterized by a great complexity and uncertainty, significantly impeding the design of adaptive forest watershed management to mitigate climate change risks. This paper reviews our current knowledge on the interactions between climate change and the forest-water nexus at the scales of individual tree, stand, and watershed. We found that climate change dramatically altered watershed hydrology in many parts of the world, with varying hydrological responses at multiple scales of tree species, forest types, climate types, and hydrological regimes. The streamflow response was often more pronounced in snow-dominated or water-limited watersheds, especially in watersheds with increasing droughts due to climate change and intensively managed plantations of either non-native tree species (e.g., Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Australia) or young coniferous species. Climate change impacts can be compounded or offset by forest changes (i.e., deforestation, and forestation) through forest-climate interactions and feedbacks. Forest management can mitigate or aggravate the negative hydrologic impacts of climate change. Adaptive forest management is a prerequisite for managing the forest-water nexus in the face of climate change. Various forest management strategies aiming at maintaining optimal forest structure and high species diversity are recommended to support forest resistance and resilience to climate change and sustain water provision services from forests and other beneficial ecosystem services while minimizing negative impacts and risks of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article

alter the distribution and activity of native and alien pathogens that infect trees and, in severe cases, cause tree death. In this study, potential future changes in climate suitability are investigated for three forest pathogens that occur in western North America: the native Arceuthobium tsugense subsp tsugense, hemlock dwarf mistletoe, and two alien invasive species, Dothistroma septosporum, the cause of red band needle blight or Dothistroma needle blight, and Phytophthora ramorum, the cause of sudden oak death or ramorum blight. Specifically, the software CLIMEX is used to calculate Cold-Stress, Heat-Stress, and Dry-Stress indices for each pathogen in 98,224 grid cells in North America. Downscaled climate projections from the general circulation models CGCM1, CSIROMk2, and HadCM3 drive forecasts for 2020, 2050 and 2080. These climate projections are then analyzed to forecast shifts in the geographic extent of abiotic stresses that are severe enough to directly kill pathogen propagules and prevent year-round establishment of these pathogens. Cold stress currently has a major impact on climate suitability for all three pathogens; heat stress is likely to become more significant in the future. I forecast that the geographic extent of cold stress will decline from its current levels by a constant 5% (± 1%) of all grid cells in each 30-yr projection horizon for all three pathogens. Forecasts suggest the extent of heat stress will increase concurrently by 4% (± 1%) in each 30-yr projection horizon. Drought stress shows no consistent trend over time. No disproportionate effect of climate change on the two alien invasive pathogens over the native is forecasted. These results suggest that forecasts of future climate suitability for pathogens based on historical climate normals are accurate for less than 30 yrs. Adaptive management strategies in forestry will be needed to respond as these changes unfold.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aArceuthobium campylopodum subsp. tsugense 3aDothistroma 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aPhytophthora ramorum 3aadaptive management 3ablight 3aclimate 3acold stress 3acomputer software 3aforest pathogens 3aforestry 3aglobal warming 3aheat stress 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3arisk 3asudden oak death 3atree mortality 3atrees 3awater stress 3aNorth America 0ared band needle blight 0ahemlock dwarf mistletoe 0aCLIMEX 0aalien invasive pathogens 0aexotic species0 tNeoBiota.g2013 Sept. 13, v. 18 p.131-150dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)219340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.18.40473Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:2193b1314-2488c18e131  fNB  aBatch:2617  aissued2 aPensoft Publisherseprovider5DNAL  aIND6069870949ExL  a2020-12-10  a/data/metadata/incoming/pensoft/neobiota-18-131.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/pensoft/neobiota-18-131.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/pensoft/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6987094  a2020-06-15  a2020-12-1003307nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003400098035002800132040001800160100012800178245013200306300001200438520034500450592002800795593001800823650001900841650001000860650001500870650001800885650001800903650002100921650001400942650001100956650002200967650001400989650002001003650001601023650001001039700010301049700010601152700014601258700019001404700014001594700018301734700011901917773009302036787003302129787001802162787001802180856008002198912001202278914003502290914000702325916001502332917001102347918003902358935002202397949001502419953005602434954006002490955003602550961001202586974001702598983001502615984001502630991631397710742620221118053825.0200615e20130913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069870862DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.18.61082doi  aagid:6987086-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKriticos, Darren J.eauthoruCSIRO Ecosystem Sciences and Biosecurity Flagship, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia10aInvasive alien species in the food chain: Advancing risk assessment models to address climate change, economics and uncertainty  ap. 1-7.  aEconomic globalization depends on the movement of people and goods between countries.

As such, projected global change includes groundwater systems. Here, groundwater is defined as all subsurface water including soil water, deeper vadose zone water, and unconfined and confined aquifer waters. Potential effects of climate change combined with land and water management on surface waters have been studied in some detail. Equivalent studies of groundwater systems have lagged behind these advances, but research and broader interest in projected climate effects on groundwater have been accelerating in recent years. In this paper, we provide an overview and synthesis of the key aspects of subsurface hydrology, including water quantity and quality, related to global change. Adaptation to global change must include prudent management of groundwater as a renewable, but slow-feedback resource in most cases. Groundwater storage is already over-tapped in many regions, yet available subsurface storage may be a key to meeting the combined demands of agriculture, industry, municipal and domestic water supply, and ecosystems during times of shortage. The future intensity and frequency of dry periods combined with warming trends need to be addressed in the context of groundwater resources, even though projections in space and time are fraught with uncertainty. Finally, potential impacts of groundwater on the global climate system are largely unknown. Research to improve our understanding of the joint behaviors of climate and groundwater is needed, and spin-off benefits on each discipline are likely.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquifers 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3aindustry 3aland management 3apublic water supply 3asoil water 3aspace and time 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3avadose zone 3awater management 3awater quality1 aTaniguchi, MakotoeauthoruResearch Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN), Kyoto, Japan1 aKooi, HenkeauthoruVU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1 aGurdak, Jason J.eauthoruSan Francisco State University, CA, USA1 aAllen, Diana M.eauthoruSimon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada1 aHiscock, Kevin M.eauthoruUniversity of East Anglia, Norwich, UK1 aTreidel, HolgereauthoruUNESCO, International Hydrological Programme (IHP), Paris, France1 aAureli, AliceeauthoruUNESCO, International Hydrological Programme (IHP), Paris, France0 tJournal of hydrology.g2011 Aug. 5, v. 405, no. 3-4 p.532-560dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4653940uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46539b0022-1694c405d3-4e532  fJournal of hydrology  aissued2 aElsevier B.V.eprovider5DNAL  aIND446047149ExL  a2013-04-29  aNAL269200022169404050003.xml  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:184 annotated on 2013-04-09T11:19:51Z  aBatch:184 reviewed on 2013-04-23T14:00:02Z  aBatch:184 reviewed on 2013-04-29T16:00:03Z  aagid:493135  a2014-11-10  a2014-11-10  a460471403933nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097024002100132035002600153040001800179072000900197072000900206072000900215072000900224072000900233100002200242245012900264300001600393500002400409520163600433593001802069650001702087650002302104650002502127650002802152650002402180650001602204650002002220650002002240650001102260650002502271650001902296650002102315650003002336650001702366651002602383653002002409653001702429700001902446700002302465773006602488787001802554787003002572787003302602852000902635856011202644856008502756912001202841914002202853917001102875930003302886935002102919945002502940946001102965949001502976952005102991961001203042974001503054984001503069985010303084986001203187991632097880742620221118183705.0100322e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443440242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-005-3990-52doi7 a10113/401542hdl  aagid:40154-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aB200 0aK001 0aX100 0aK0011 aIverson, Louis R.10aPotential colonization of newly available tree-species habitat under climate change: an analysis for five eastern US species  ap. 787-799.  aIncludes references  aWe used a combination of two models, DISTRIB and SHIFT, to estimate potential migration of five tree species into suitable habitat due to climate change over the next 100 years. These species, currently confined to the eastern half of the United States and not extending into Canada, are Diospyros virginiana (persimmon), Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum), Oxydendrum arboreum (sourwood), Pinus taeda (loblolly pine), and Quercus falcata var. falcata (southern red oak). DISTRIB uses a statistical approach to assess potential suitable habitat under equilibrium of 2 x CO2. SHIFT uses a cellular automata approach to estimate migration and is driven primarily by the abundance of the species near the boundary, forest density inside and outside of the boundary, and distance between cells. For each cell outside the current boundary, SHIFT creates an estimate of the probability that each unoccupied target cell will become colonized over 100 years. By evaluating the probability of colonization within the potential 'new' suitable habitat, we can estimate the proportion of new habitat that might be colonized within a century. This proportion is low (<15%) for all five species, suggesting that there is a serious lag between the potential movement of suitable habitat and the potential for the species to migrate into the new habitat. However, humans could hasten the migration of certain species by physically moving the propagules, especially for certain rare species that are unable to move sufficiently through fragmented landscapes, or even more common species, e.g., beech, that have lost many of their animal dispersers.  aPubAg article 3aforest trees 3acolonizing ability 3aDiospyros virginiana 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3aOxydendrum arboreum 3aPinus taeda 3aQuercus falcata 3aforest habitats 3amodels 3aprobability analysis 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3ageographical distribution 3aspatial data 3aEastern United States 0aplant migration 0arange shifts1 aSchwartz, M.W.1 aPrasad, Anantha M.0 tLandscape ecology.g2004 Oct., v.  19, no.  7 p.787-7997nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/401543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-005-3990-53Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fLandscape ecology  aissued  a20100413b20100501c00000000  aIND443440249ExL  aINDdLYNe2010/04/02  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20100413 20100501 00000000bIND LYN 2010/04/02  aUSDA/FS  aagid:40154  a2010-05-01  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a434402403924nab a2200973 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003200097024002100129035002600150040001800176072000900194100002000203245008400223300001400307500002400321520090500345593001801250593002001268650001301288650002101301650001901322650001301341650002901354650002901383650002401412650001101436700002501447700002401472700001601496700001801512700002001530700002101550700002001571700001801591700001901609700001701628700002101645700003101666700001801697700002501715700002201740700002601762700001701788700001701805700001701822700002201839700001501861700001701876700002601893700001901919700002301938700002001961700002901981700002102010700001702031700001802048700001902066700001602085773010502101787001802206787003302224787003002257787002402287852000902311856011202320856008202432912001202514914004502526914005202571917001102623930003302634935002102667945002502688946001302713949001502726952005102741961001302792974001502805984001502820985010302835986001202938991632121500742620221118185329.0100328e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443470822DNAL7 a10.1175/2009BAMS2769.12doi7 a10113/401222hdl  aagid:40122-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB2001 aMahmood, Rezaul10aImpacts of land use-land cover change on climate and future research priorities  ap. 37-46.  aIncludes references  aSeveral recommendations have been proposed for detecting land use and land cover change (LULCC) on the environment from, observed climatic records and to modeling to improve its understanding and its impacts on climate. Researchers need to detect LULCCs accurately at appropriate scales within a specified time period to better understand their impacts on climate and provide improved estimates of future climate. The US Climate Reference Network (USCRN) can be helpful in monitoring impacts of LULCC on near-surface atmospheric conditions, including temperature. The USCRN measures temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and ground or skin temperature.

Ongoing research indicates that establishment of larval parasitoids depends upon the season-long availability of host stages susceptible to parasitism. We monitored emerald ash borer overwintering stages at 90 sites across 22 states to: 1) produce a model of the percentage of emerald ash borer overwintering as non-J larvae; 2) link that model to establishment of Tetrastichus planipennisi; and 3) explore changes to our model under climate change scenarios. Accumulated growing degree days (GDD) is an important predictor of the proportion of emerald ash borer overwintering as non-J larvae (1–4 instar larvae under the bark; available to parasitoids emerging in spring) versus J-larvae (fourth-instar larvae in pupal chambers in the outer wood; unavailable to parasitoids). From north to south, the availability of non-J emerald ash borer larvae in the spring decreases as accumulated GDD increases. In areas where the model predicted >46–75%, >30–46%, >13–30%, or ≤13% of emerald ash borer overwintering as non-J larvae, the probability of establishment of T. planipennisi was 92%, 67%, 57%, and 21%, respectively. We determined that 13% of emerald ash borer overwintering as non-J larvae was the lowest threshold for expected T. planipennisi establishment. Additional modeling predicts that under climate change, establishment of T. planipennisi will be most affected in the Central United States, with areas that are currently suitable becoming unsuitable. Our results provide a useful tool for the emerald ash borer biological control program on how to economically and successfully deploy emerald ash borer biological control agents.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aTetrastichus planipennisi 3abark 3abiological control 3aclimate change 3aentomology 3aforests 3ainstars 3amodels 3aoverwintering 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aphenology 3aprobability 3apupae 3aspring 3awood 0aemerald ash borer 0agrowing degree days 0amodeling1 aWarden, Melissa L.eauthoruUSDA APHIS PPQ S&T, Otis ANGB Lab, MA 025421 aSlager, Benjamin H.eauthoruUSDA APHIS PPQ 5936 Ford Court Suite 200, Brighton, MI 481161 aMurphy, Theresa C.eauthoruUSDA APHIS PPQ S&T, Otis ANGB Lab, MA 025420 tJournal of economic entomology.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 113, no. 6 p.2641-2649dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4627640uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toaa2173Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46276b0022-0493c113d6e2641  fJournal of economic entomology  aBatch:10073  aissued2 aBioOneeprovider5DNAL  aIND6072566719ExL  a2021-05-24  a/data/metadata/incoming/bioone/toaa217_front.xml.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/bioone/toaa217_front.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/bioone/  aUSDA/APHIS  aagid:7256671  a2021-01-28  a2021-05-2404688nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002500098035002800123040001800151100018900169245011000358300001600468520100300484592002801487593001801515650001901533650001001552650001501562650001501577650001701592650001401609650001101623650001401634650001401648650001301662650001501675653005301690653001901743653001701762653003201779653001401811653001001825653001701835653001201852653001401864700018401878700017702062700018902239700014502428700014502573700024202718700019102960700020803151773012603359787003303485787001803518787001903536856007303555912001203628914004103640914002903681916001503710917001103725918002703736935002203763949001503785953003403800961001303834962004803847974001703895983001503912984001503927991632748660742620221118165732.0151105e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012610662DNAL7 a10.1654/4724b.12doi  aagid:1261066-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooks, Daniel R.eauthoruH.

Recognizing a nexus of professional opportunities and global public need, we gathered at the Cedar Point Biological Station of the University of Nebraska in September 2012 to formulate a cooperative and broad platform for providing essential information about the evolution, ecology, and epidemiology of parasites across host groups, parasite groups, geographical regions, and ecosystem types. A general protocol, documentation–assessment–monitoring–action (DAMA), suggests an integrated proposal to build a proactive capacity to understand, anticipate, and respond to the outcomes of accelerating environmental change. We seek to catalyze discussion and mobilize action within the parasitological community and, more widely, among zoologists and disease ecologists at a time of expanding environmental perturbation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3acrops 3aecologists 3aecosystems 3aepidemiology 3aevolution 3ahumans 3alivestock 3aparasites 3awildlife 3azoologists 0adocumentation–assessment–monitoring–action 0aclimate change 0abiodiversity 0aemerging infectious disease 0aparasites 0ahosts 0aepidemiology 0aecology 0aevolution1 aHoberg, Eric P.eauthoruU.S. National Parasite Collection, Agricultural Research Service, USDA, Beltsville Area Research Center, BARC East 1180 Beltsville, Maryland 20705, U.S.A.1 aBoeger, Walter A.eauthoruLaboratório de Ecologia Molecular e Parasitologia Evolutiva, Universidade Federal do Paraná, Caixa Postal 19073, Curitiba, PR 81531-980, Brazil1 aGardner, Scott L.eauthoruH.

A convergence of these issues is occurring in the Midwestern United States, i.e. the ‘cornbelt’ region that provides substantial grain supplies to world markets but is also well known for its contribution to hypoxic conditions in the Gulf of Mexico due to agricultural nutrient losses. This review examines anticipated trends in climate and possible consequences for grain production and soil resource management in this region. The historic climate of this region has been ideal for large-scale agriculture, and its soils are among the world’s most productive. Yet under current trends, degradation of the soil resource threatens our capacity to ensure a stable food supply and a clean environment in the face of a changing climate. A set of strategies and practices can be implemented to meet these challenges by maintaining and improving hydrologic and plant-growth functions of soil, which will improve outcomes for aquatic ecosystems and for the agricultural sector. Soil management ensures our long-term capacity to provide a reliable food supply, and mitigates pressures to expand agricultural practices into marginal croplands that would lead to further environmental degradation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acrop production 3asoil conservation 3aanaerobic conditions 3aworld markets 3aagricultural land 3aecosystem services 3asoil degradation 3asoil 3aagricultural industry 3aclimate change 3afood availability 3ahydrology 3afood production 3agrains 3asoil management 3asoil resources 3aclimate 3aMidwestern United States 3aGulf of Mexico 0aagroecosystems 0afood supply 0afood security 0ahypoxia1 aCruse, R.

This study estimated the effect on US timber and primary forest product markets of hypothetical timber set-aside scenarios where US forest landowners would be paid to forego timber harvests for 100 years to increase carbon storage on US timberland. The scenarios featured payments to landowners of $0 (business-as-usual (BAU)), $10, and $15 per each additional metric ton (t) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) sequestered on the set-aside timberlands, with maximum annual expenditures of $3 billion. For the set-aside scenarios, reduction in timberland available for harvest resulted in increased timber prices and changes in US domestic production, consumption, net export, and timber market welfare. Economic analyses indicated that the scenario with more area set aside and the largest carbon mitigation benefit (lower carbon price, $10/t CO₂e) would result in the largest decrease in market welfare, suggesting that climate change mitigation policies and programs would need to consider such impacts when evaluating the costs and benefits of climate change mitigation strategies in the forest sector.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aeconomic analysis 3aexports 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3alandowners 3aprices 3atimber supply 3awoodlands 3aUnited States1 aInce, Peter J.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory, One Gifford Pinchot Drive, Madison, WI 53726, USA.1 aSkog, Kenneth E.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory, One Gifford Pinchot Drive, Madison, WI 53726, USA.1 aChang, Sun J.eauthoru227 School of Renewable Natural Resources Building, LSU AgCenter, Baton Rouge, LA 70803, USA.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2013 Mar. 14, v. 43, no. 3 p.245-255dNRC Research Pressx1208-60377nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl200340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2012-03313Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl2003b1208-6037c43d3e245  fCanadian journal of forest research =  aBatch:1389  aissued2 aNRC Canadaeprovider5DNAL  aIND6051586099ExL  a2016-08-22  aCJFRv43i3-04040855-313291.zip  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1389 reviewed on 2016-08-22T13:00:02Z  aagid:5158609  a2016-03-21  a2016-08-2203934nab a2200649 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003200098035002800130040001800158100013600176245012900312300001600441520137200457592002801829593001801857650001201875650001901887650001201906650001501918650001301933650001901946650001701965650001501982650002201997650001602019650001402035651001502049653001202064653002802076653001402104653001902118700013702137700013502274700013302409700013002542773013202672787003302804787001802837787002102855856007802876912001202954914004302966914004003009916001503049917001103064918003103075935002203106949001503128953003403143961001203177962004803189974001703237983001503254984001503269991632933080742620221118184844.0160321e20140103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051587662DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2013-03832doi  aagid:5158766-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucash, Melissa S.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental Science and Management, Portland State University, Portland, OR 97201, USA.10aImpacts of fire and climate change on long-term nitrogen availability and forest productivity in the New Jersey Pine Barrens  ap. 404-412.  aIncreased wildfires and temperatures due to climate change are expected to have profound effects on forest productivity and nitrogen (N) cycling. Forecasts about how wildfire and climate change will affect forests seldom consider N availability, which may limit forest response to climate change, particularly in fire-prone landscapes. The overall objective of this study was to examine how wildfire and climate change affect long-term mineral N availability in a fire-prone landscape. We employed a commonly used landscape simulation model (LANDIS-II) in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, a landscape characterized by frequent small fires and fire-resilient vegetation. We found that fire had little effect on mineral N, whereas climate change and fire together reduced mineral N by the end of the century. Though N initially limited forest productivity, mineral N was no longer limiting after 50 years. Our results suggest that mineral N is resilient to fire under our current climate but not under climate change. Also, predictions that do not consider N limitation may underestimate short-term but not long-term productivity responses to climate change. Together these results illustrate the importance of including N dynamics when simulating the effects of climate change on forest productivity, particularly in fire-prone regions such as the New Jersey Pine Barrens.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aforests 3alandscapes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3apine barrens 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3atemperature 3awildfires 3aNew Jersey 0aCentury 0aforest simulation model 0aLANDIS-II 0anitrogen cycle1 aScheller, Robert M.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental Science and Management, Portland State University, Portland, OR 97201, USA.1 aKretchun, Alec M.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental Science and Management, Portland State University, Portland, OR 97201, USA.1 aClark, Kenneth L.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Silas Little Experimental Forest, 501 Four Mile Road, New Lisbon, NJ 08064, USA.1 aHom, JohneauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, 11 Campus Blvd., Suite 200, Newtown Square, PA 19073, USA.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2014 Jan. 3, v. 44, no. 5 p.404-412dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl200340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2013-03833Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl2003b1208-6037c44d5e404  fCanadian journal of forest research  aBatch:1389  aissued2 aNRC Canadaeprovider5DNAL  aIND6051587669ExL  a2016-08-22  aCJFRv44i5-04210953-439355.zip  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1389 reviewed on 2016-08-22T13:00:02Z  aagid:5158766  a2016-03-21  a2019-05-0605929nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024005700097035002800154040001800182100013500200245010100335300001600436500002000452520336400472592002803836593001803864650001903882650002103901650003203922650001703954650001203971650001403983650001303997650001904010650001504029650001504044650001104059650001504070650001804085650002404103650001104127650001604138650002104154651002104175700014004196700014804336700014404484773011004628787003304738787001804771787001904789852000904808856010704817912001204924914001804936914002604954916001504980917001104995918004305006935002105049949001505070953002705085961001205112962004805124974001705172983001505189984001505204986001205219991632953990742620221118185258.0161030e199908  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220027992DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0375:GRTCIP]2.0.CO;22doi  aagid:1942284-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehfeldt, Gerald E.eauthoruRocky Mountain Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 1221 South Main Street, Moscow, Idaho 83843 USA10aGenetic responses to climate in pinus contorta: niche breadth, climate change, and reforestation  ap. 375-407.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFundamental plant–environment relationships were revealed by analyses of 20‐yr height and survival of 118 populations representing two subspecies of Pinus contorta growing in common gardens at 60 environmentally disparate test sites in British Columbia. The approach involved (1) preparing models that described the general climate of British Columbia, (2) developing population‐specific response functions driven by predicted climate variables, (3) developing general transfer functions that predict performance from the climatic distances over which populations were transferred, and (4) interpreting the results in terms of niche breadth, effects of climate change on adaptedness of populations, and reforestation in a changing environment. Polynomial regression models used physiographic descriptors to predict seven climate variables from normalized records of 513 weather stations. Values of R² ranged over 0.80–0.97 for thermal variables and 0.54–0.61 for precipitation variables. Validations with independent data from 45 stations were strong and suggested that the models were generally free of bias within the limits of the original data. Response functions describing the height or survival of each population were developed from quadratic regressions using predicted climate variables for each test site. Mean annual temperature and mean temperature in the coldest month were the most effective variables for predicting population height, while the ratio of summer temperature to summer moisture was the best predictor of survival. Validation of the response functions with independent data from two additional test sites produced values of R² between actual and predicted values that were as high as 0.93 for height and 0.73 for survival. The results demonstrated that natural populations have different climatic optima but tend to occupy suboptimal environments. Nevertheless, the general transfer functions showed that optimal growth and survival of the species as a whole is associated with the null transfer distance. These seemingly anomalous results suggest that the same processes thought to determine the distribution of species control the distribution of genotypes within species: (1) environmental selection to produce a broad fundamental niche, and (2) density‐dependent selection to produce a relatively narrow realized niche within which most populations are relegated to suboptimal environments. Consequently, the steep geographic clines typical of P. contorta seem to be driven more by density‐dependent selection than by environmental selection. Asymmetric gene flow from the center of distribution toward the periphery is viewed as a primary regulator that provides the fuel for both environmental and density‐dependent selection and thereby indirectly perpetuates suboptimality. The response functions predict that small changes in climate will greatly affect growth and survival of forest tree populations and, therefore, that maintaining contemporary forest productivities during global warming will require a wholesale redistribution of genotypes across the landscape. The response functions also provide the climatic bases to current reforestation guidelines and quantify the adjustments necessary for maintaining adaptedness in planted trees during periods of small (∼1°C) temporal temperature shifts.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aPinus contorta 3aclimatic factors 3adensity dependent selection 3aforest trees 3aforests 3agene flow 3agenotype 3aglobal warming 3aguidelines 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aprediction 3areforestation 3aregression analysis 3asummer 3atemperature 3aweather stations 3aBritish Columbia1 aYing, Cheng C.eauthoruBritish Columbia Ministry of Forests, Research Branch, P.O.

We encourage flexible approaches that promote reversible and incremental steps, and that favor ongoing learning and capacity to modify direction as situations change. We suggest that no single solution fits all future challenges, especially in the context of changing climates, and that the best strategy is to mix different approaches for different situations. Resources managers will be challenged to integrate adaptation strategies (actions that help ecosystems accommodate changes adaptively) and mitigation strategies (actions that enable ecosystems to reduce anthropogenic influences on global climate) into overall plans. Adaptive strategies include resistance options (forestall impacts and protect highly valued resources), resilience options (improve the capacity of ecosystems to return to desired conditions after disturbance), and response options (facilitate transition of ecosystems from current to new conditions). Mitigation strategies include options to sequester carbon and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions. Priority‐setting approaches (e.g., triage), appropriate for rapidly changing conditions and for situations where needs are greater than available capacity to respond, will become increasingly important in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3aforest management 3aforest ecosystems 3aanthropogenic activities 3apollution control 3acarbon sequestration 3agreenhouse gases 3aair pollution 3aforest fires 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aForestryxmethods 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aTreesxphysiology 2aUncertainty1 aStephenson, Nathan L.eauthoruU.S. Geological Survey, Sequoia–Kings Canyon Field Station, 47050 Generals Highway, Three Rivers, California 93271 USA1 aStephens, Scott L.eauthoruDivision of Ecosystem Science, Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, 137 Mulford Hall, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-3114 USA0 tEcological applications.g2007 Dec., v. 17, no. 8 p.2145-2151dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl47193  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/97573Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1715.13Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl47193b1051-0761c17d8e2145  fEcological applications  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND440072109ExL  a2018-03-21  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/10510761_2007_17_8.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/10510761_2007_17_8.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:9757  a2018-03-21  a2018-03-21  a400721005347nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002000097024003700117035002500154040001800179100002000197245008300217300001600300500031900316500001500635520274900650592002803399593001803427650002103445650002303466650001503489650002403504650001303528650001703541650001803558650001703576650002103593650002503614650001903639650001803658650002003676650002503696653001903721700002703740700002703767700002603794773012103820787001803941787003303959787003003992787002204022852000904044856011104053856008404164912001204248914004604260914001704306917001104323918003504334935002104369949001504390953006204405954006504467955003604532961001304568974001404581983001504595984001504610986001204625991633343080742620221118144706.0181002e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440044682DNAL7 a10113/97472hdl7 a10.1097/ss.0b013e31815cc4982doi  aagid:9747-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLal, R.eauthor10aSoil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change and advance food security  ap. 943-956.  aAffiliations: 1Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.

Most agricultural soils have lost 30% to 75% of their antecedent soil organic carbon (SOC) pool or 30 to 40 t C ha. The magnitude of loss is often more in soils prone to accelerated erosion and other degradative processes. On a global scale, CO2-C emissions since 1850 are estimated at 270 ± 30 giga ton (billion ton or Gt) from fossil fuel combustion compared with 78 ± 12 Gt from soils. Consequently, the SOC pool in agricultural soils is much lower than their potential capacity. Furthermore, depletion of the SOC pool also leads to degradation in soil quality and declining agronomic/biomass productivity. Therefore, conversion to restorative land uses (e.g., afforestation, improved pastures) and adoption of recommended management practices (RMP) can enhance SOC and improve soil quality. Important RMP for enhancing SOC include conservation tillage, mulch farming, cover crops, integrated nutrient management including use of manure and compost, and agroforestry. Restoration of degraded/desertified soils and ecosystems is an important strategy. The rate of SOC sequestration, ranging from 100 to 1000 kg ha year, depends on climate, soil type, and site-specific management. Total potential of SOC sequestration in the United States of 144 to 432 Mt year (288 Mt year) comprises 45 to 98 Mt in cropland, 13 to 70 Mt in grazing land, and 25 to 102 Mt in forestland. The global potential of SOC sequestration is estimated at 0.6 to 1.2 Gt C year, comprising 0.4 to 0.8 Gt C year through adoption of RMP on cropland (1350 Mha), and 0.01 to 0.03 Gt C year on irrigated soils (275 Mha), and 0.01 to 0.3 Gt C year through improvements of rangelands and grasslands (3700 Mha). In addition, there is a large potential of C sequestration in biomass in forest plantations, short rotation woody perennials, and so on. The attendant improvement in soil quality with increase in SOC pool size has a strong positive impact on agronomic productivity and world food security. An increase in the SOC pool within the root zone by 1 t C ha year can enhance food production in developing countries by 30 to 50 Mt year including 24 to 40 Mt year of cereal and legumes, and 6 to 10 Mt year of roots and tubers. Despite the enormous challenge of SOC sequestration, especially in regions of warm and arid climates and predominantly resource-poor farmers, it is a truly a win-win strategy. While improving ecosystem services and ensuring sustainable use of soil resources, SOC sequestration also mitigates global warming by offsetting fossil fuel emissions and improving water quality by reducing nonpoint source pollution.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3arange management 3aagricultural soils 3afood crops 3asoil organic carbon 3apastures 3aagroforestry 3aafforestation 3asoil quality 3asoil degradation 3acarbon sequestration 3aglobal warming 3afood security 3afood production 3aconservation tillage 0aclimate change1 aFollett, R.

The potential for global climate changes to increase the risk of soil erosion is clear, but the actual damage is not. The objectives of this study were to develop a method for downscaling monthly climate forecasts to daily weather series using a climate generator (CLIGEN), and to determine the potential impacts of projected mean and variance changes in precipitation and temperature on soil erosion and wheat (Triticum Aestivum L.) yield. Monthly forecasts for the periods of 1950–1999 and 2056–2085 for the Oklahoma region, projected by a general circulation model (HadCM3), were used. Projected mean and variance changes in precipitation and temperatures between the two periods were satisfactorily incorporated into CLIGEN input parameters derived for the El Reno station, Oklahoma, and future transitional probabilities of precipitation occurrence were estimated as a linear function of historical monthly precipitation. Five climate change scenarios were constructed, and the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was run for each combination of five climate scenarios and three tillage systems. A 50% increase in CO₂ resulted in some 26% increase in wheat yield. At that elevated CO₂ level, projected decrease in total precipitation decreased surface runoff, soil loss, and wheat yield. However, predicted changes in precipitation variance increased runoff by 15 to 17%, and increased soil loss by 10 and 19% under conservation and conventional tillage, respectively. Predicted increase in mean temperature reduced wheat yield by 31%, and increased soil loss by 40 and 19% under conservation and conventional tillage, respectively. Under the assumed climate change, predicted average soil loss under conventional tillage was about 2.6 times that under conservation tillage and 29 times that under no-till. With all changes considered, predicted average wheat yield during 2056–2085, compared with the present climate at the present CO₂ level, would decrease by 12%; runoff would increase by <7%; and soil loss would increase by <8% in all tillage systems. Overall results indicate that adoption of conservation tillage and no-till will be effective in controlling soil erosion under projected climate change used in this study.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3asimulation models 3acarbon dioxide 3agreenhouse gases 3aplant growth 3astormwater 3atillage 3aagricultural runoff 3aWater Erosion Prediction Project 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aTriticum aestivum 3aweather forecasting 3asoil erosion 3atemperature 3aclimatic factors1 aNearing, M.

Adoption timing and rates are varied across countries in the different scenarios. The results are consistent between the scenarios examined. Early adopters benefit the most, there is no incentive for more producers to adopt after 60 to 95% have adopted (meaning the adoption ceiling has been reached), and slower adoption corresponds to ceilings closer to 60 than 95%. When individual countries must decide whether or not to invest in ENSO technology and producer education programs to encourage adoption, results indicate the dominant strategy for each country is to invest. This is especially true if producers in other countries are adopting the use of climate forecasts.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3asimulation models 3adecision support systems 3aEl Nino 3ainnovation adoption 3awheat 3adryland farming 3acrop yield 3aweather forecasting 3aclimate models 3asurpluses 3adecision making 3aprediction 3aCanada 3aUnited States 3aAustralia 0acrop production 0aweather1 aMjelde, James W.1 aLove, H.

As such, climate change mitigation and adaptation are incidental to a larger enterprise that employs a systems approach to managing landscapes and communities. The transformative potential of regenerative agriculture has seen growing attention in the popular press, but few empirical studies have explored the processes by which farmers enter into, navigate, and, importantly, sustain the required paradigm shift in their approach to managing their properties, farm businesses, and personal lives. We draw on theories and insights associated with relational thinking to analyze the experiences of farmers in Australia who have undertaken and sustained transitions from conventional to regenerative agriculture. We present a conceptual framework of “zones of friction and traction” occurring in personal, practical, and political spheres of transformation that both challenge and facilitate the transition process. Our findings illustrate the ways in which deeply held values and emotions influence and interact with mental models, worldviews, and cultural norms as a result of regular monitoring; and how behavioral change is sustained through the establishment of self-amplifying positive feedbacks involving biophilic emotions, a sense of well-being, and an ever-expanding worldview. We conclude that transitioning to regenerative agriculture involves more than a suite of ‘climate-smart’ mitigation and adaptation practices supported by technical innovation, policy, education, and outreach. Rather, it involves subjective, nonmaterial factors associated with culture, values, ethics, identity, and emotion that operate at individual, household, and community scales and interact with regional, national and global processes. Findings have implications for strategies aimed at facilitating a large-scale transition to climate-smart regenerative agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cRural Housing Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000091670 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abehavior change 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aeducation 3aemotions 3aempirical research 3aethics 3afarmers 3afarms 3afriction 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aorganic soils 3aoutreach 3apolitics 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3asustainable agriculture 3aAustralia 0aClimate change adaptation and mitigation 0aHolistic Management 0aTransformative learning 0aCommunities of practice 0aEarth stewardship 0aRelational thinking1 aGill, NicholaseauthoruAustralian Centre for Culture, Environment, Society & Space, University of Wollongong, Northfields Ave., Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia1 aVoyer, MichelleeauthoruFaculty of Law, Humanities and the Arts, University of Wollongong, Northfields Ave., Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6170-99940 tGlobal environmental change.g2019 Nov., v. 59 p.101965-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2063x0959-37807nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)206340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2019.1019653Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/67622333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:2063b0959-3780c59  fGlobal environmental change  aBatch:2418  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6067622339ExL  a2020-03-05  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/155209357669562851-00004-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0959378018309117.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 0959-3780  aMissing ISSN  aagid:6762233  a2022-09-14  a2022-09-1406025nab a2201009 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098024003800139024002200177024001900199035002800218040001800246100015800264245013700422300001600559506002800575506003600603506007600639506003100715520198700746592002802733593001802761596006402779596004602843596006002889506003702949650003002986650004103016650002203057650001303079650001903092650001903111650001203130650001203142650002303154650000903177650001803186650002203204650001703226650001203243650001703255650001403272650001503286650001303301650001103314650001603325650001603341650001603357650001303373650001103386651001103397651002303408653001903431653001603450653001603466653001203482653001403494700011403508700015503622700016703777700011003944700011304054700011404167773013104281787003304412787001804445787002104463856008504484903002404569912001204593914003104605914003404636916001504670917001104685918003604696935002204732949001504754953009104769954006104860955003504921961001204956974001704968983001504985984001505000991572058700742620221207092900.0200503e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058587332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.11.0042chorus7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.11.0042doi7 aPMC57461992pmcid7 a292906442pmid  aagid:5858733-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgne, Michelle C.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Engineering, Resources, and Management, Oregon State University, 280 Peavy Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA10aInteractions of predominant insects and diseases with climate change in Douglas-fir forests of western Oregon and Washington, U.S.A.  ap. 317-332.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aForest disturbance regimes are beginning to show evidence of climate-mediated changes, such as increasing severity of droughts and insect outbreaks. We review the major insects and pathogens affecting the disturbance regime for coastal Douglas-fir forests in western Oregon and Washington State, USA, and ask how future climate changes may influence their role in disturbance ecology. Although the physiological constraints of light, temperature, and moisture largely control tree growth, episodic and chronic disturbances interacting with biological factors have substantial impacts on the structure and functioning of forest ecosystems in this region. Understanding insect and disease interactions is critical to predicting forest response to climate change and the consequences for ecosystem services, such as timber, clean water, fish and wildlife. We focused on future predictions for warmer wetter winters, hotter drier summers, and elevated atmospheric CO₂ to hypothesize the response of Douglas-fir forests to the major insects and diseases influencing this forest type: Douglas-fir beetle, Swiss needle cast, black stain root disease, and laminated root rot. We hypothesize that (1) Douglas-fir beetle and black stain root disease could become more prevalent with increasing, fire, temperature stress, and moisture stress, (2) future impacts of Swiss needle cast are difficult to predict due to uncertainties in May-July leaf wetness, but warmer winters could contribute to intensification at higher elevations, and (3) laminated root rot will be influenced primarily by forest management, rather than climatic change. Furthermore, these biotic disturbance agents interact in complex ways that are poorly understood. Consequently, to inform management decisions, insect and disease influences on disturbance regimes must be characterized specifically by forest type and region in order to accurately capture these interactions in light of future climate-mediated changes.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cOregon State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009612  cUSEPAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000139  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000069590 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDendroctonus pseudotsugae 3aPseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii 3aSwiss needle cast 3aaltitude 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecology 3aecosystem services 3afish 3aforest damage 3aforest management 3aforest types 3ainsects 3aleaf wetness 3apathogens 3aprediction 3aroot rot 3asummer 3atemperature 3atree growth 3auncertainty 3awildlife 3awinter 3aOregon 3aWashington (state) 0aClimate change 0aDouglas-fir 0aDisturbance 0aInsects 0aPathogens1 aBeedlow, Peter A.eauthoruU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 200 SW 35th Street, Corvallis, OR 97333, USA1 aShaw, David C.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Engineering, Resources, and Management, Oregon State University, 280 Peavy Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA1 aWoodruff, David R.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, Forestry Sciences Laboratory, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97333, USA1 aLee, E.

The extent to which people facing exacerbated hazard conditions understand or respond to climate-related changes to local hazards has been largely overlooked. In this article, we examine the relationships among climate change beliefs, environmental beliefs, and hazard mitigation actions in the context of wildfire, a natural hazard projected to be intensified by climate change. We find that survey respondents are situated across a continuum between being ‘believers’ and ‘deniers’ that is multidimensional. Placement on this believer–denier spectrum is related to general environmental attitudes. We fail, however, to find a relationship between climate change beliefs and wildfire risk-reduction actions in general. In contrast, we find a statistically significant positive relationship between level of wildfire risk mitigation and being a climate denier. Further, certain pro-environmental attitudes are found to have a statistically significant negative association with the level of wildfire risk mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cU.S. Forest Service 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asurveys 3awildfires1 aMeldrum, James R.eauthor1 aChamp, Patricia A.eauthor0 tEnvironmental Hazards.dInforma UK Limitedx1878-00597nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2809640uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17477891.2015.10806563Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:28096c14d4e341  fEnvironmental Hazards  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073451249ExL  a2022-04-22  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7345124  aArticle missing volume number  a2022-09-06  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl04014nab a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003900121024004200160035002800202040001800230100008100248245009200329300001600421520185100437592002802288593001802316596004702334650001202381650001902393650001202412650001302424651001002437700009102447700008402538700007002622773010002692787003302792787001802825856011402843856008502957912001203042914002403054917001103078918002703089935002203116949001503138952001903153955003403172961000903206962003003215962004703245974001703292983003003309984001503339985010603354991572257810742620221121015700.0220901e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073450762DNAL7 a10113/73450762hdl7 a10.1080/14616688.2017.13994372doi7 a10.1080/14616688.2017.13994372chorus  aagid:7345076-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilkins, EmilyeauthoruSchool of Forest Resources, University of Maine, USA10aWeather sensitivity and climate change perceptions of tourists: a segmentation analysis  ap. 273-289.  aMany communities rely on tourism spending, so it is important to understand any potential changes to tourist flows resulting from changing climate and weather patterns. However, tourists are not a homogenous group, as they have different motivations, values, and goals. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to better understand potentially varying perceptions and behavior of different tourist types, specifically in regards to their weather sensitivity, climate change concern, and behavioral intention for climate change mitigation. Tourists were randomly surveyed at 20 locations throughout the state of Maine in the United States (n = 704). Segmentation analysis on the activities tourists participated in yielded three segments of Maine tourists: non-nature-based tourists (50.6%), nature-based generalists (16.2%), and nature-based specialists (33.2%). Differences across segments were explored for perceptions of weather impacts, climate change concern, and mitigation intent. Additionally, weather sensitivity was analyzed based on type of overnight accommodations to better understand if this also had a role in differences. Non-nature-based tourists thought that weather variables were less influential during their travels in Maine than the other segments, while nature-based generalists perceived weather to have the highest influence. Additionally, nature-based specialists had the highest level of climate change belief, while nature-based generalists had the highest willingness to engage in climate change mitigation behavior. Results are useful to understand how segments of tourism demand may be altered with a changing climate, such as increased temperatures, precipitation, and storms, and what groups may be the most beneficial to target for marketing or educational efforts to reduce the impact of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3atourism 3atourists 3aMaine1 ade Urioste-Stone, SandraeauthoruSchool of Forest Resources, University of Maine, USA1 aWeiskittel, AaroneauthoruSchool of Forest Resources, University of Maine, USA1 aGabe, ToddeauthoruSchool of Economics, University of Maine, USA0 tTourism Geographies.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 20, no. 2 p.273-289dInforma UK Limitedx1461-66887nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73450763Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616688.2017.13994373Available from publisher's site  aArticle  fTourism Geographies  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073450769ExL  a2022-04-21  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1470-1340  aagid:7345076  a2022-09-01T12:45:41-04:00  a2022-09-15  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl02796nab a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003900121024004200160035002800202040001800230100010300248245007900351300001400430520057500444592002801019593001801047596005201065650001101117650001901128650002801147650001301175700010001188700007201288773014101360787003301501787001801534787001901552856011401571856008501685912001201770914002901782914005201811916001601863917001101879918002701890935002201917949001501939955003401954961000901988962003001997962004702027974001702074983003002091984001502121985010602136991572258230742620221121015643.0220901e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073450892DNAL7 a10113/73450892hdl7 a10.1080/1533015x.2018.14311642doi7 a10.1080/1533015x.2018.14311642chorus  aagid:7345089-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonroe, Martha C.eauthoruSchool of Forest Resources and Conservation, University of Florida, USA10aTalking about climate change: How to enhance trust with forestry audiences  ap. 43-52.  aConducting a climate change presentation or workshop can be uncomfortable for adult educators because they do not want to alienate audiences or diminish their credibility among those who doubt climate change is a problem.

However, few have investigated how framing applies to adolescents. Similarly, little research has focused on agricultural audiences, who are among the most vulnerable to and least accepting of climate change. Among 950 high school agriculture students in North Carolina, we found agriculture and environment framing of climate change, but not community and health frames, elicited feelings of worry, and these together with community frames elicited hope. Further, students feeling more worry were more supportive of individual and collective action. Those accepting climate change and females had more emotive responses and higher support for all action measures, and acceptance of human causes predicted more worry and support for collective action. We find these results encouraging as agriculture teachers likely employ agriculture and environment frames when following best teaching practices.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acollective action 3aeducational research 3aenvironmental education 3ahumans 3apsychological stress 3aNorth Carolina1 aKing, Tasha L.eauthoruForestry & Environmental Resources, North Carolina State University, USA1 aSelm, Kathryn R.eauthoruForestry & Environmental Resources, North Carolina State University, USA1 aPeterson, M.

An academic database, EBSCOhost, was used to identify 959 unique citation records addressing climate change education. Of these, 49 sources met the criteria of focusing on assessment of climate change education interventions. Analysis of these sources examined the intervention purpose, assessment methodology, and identified strategies that might result in effective interventions. Two themes were identified that are common to most environmental education: (1) focusing on personally relevant and meaningful information and (2) using active and engaging teaching methods. Four themes specific to issues such as climate change were also generated: (1) engaging in deliberative discussions, (2) interacting with scientists, (3) addressing misconceptions, and (4) implementing school or community projects. Suggestions for addressing controversial topics like climate change are offered.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aeducational research 3aenvironmental education 3asystematic review1 aPlate, Richard R.eauthoruOffice of Interdisciplinary Studies, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA1 aOxarart, AnnieeauthoruSchool of Forest Resources and Conservation, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA1 aBowers, AlisoneauthoruSchool of Education, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA1 aChaves, Willandia A.eauthoruSchool of Forest Resources and Conservation, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA0 tEnvironmental Education Research.g2017 Aug. 13, v. 25, no. 6 p.791-812dInforma UK LimitedwJournal:12202x1350-46227nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1220240uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504622.2017.13608423Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:12202c25d6e791  fEnvironmental Education Research  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073450479ExL  a2022-04-21  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1469-5871  aagid:7345047  a2022-09-01T12:45:42-04:00  a2022-09-29  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl06346nab a2200937 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098035002800139040001800167100013800185245011200323300001600435520298400451592002803435593001803463650001403481650001403495650001403509650001503523650001703538650002303555650001903578650001703597650001203614650001903626650002303645650002603668650002503694650002003719650001203739650002903751650001003780650001303790650001503803650002103818650001103839650001503850650002403865650001503889650002403904650002603928650001703954650002203971650001603993650001804009650001304027650000904040651001404049653002504063653002804088653001904116653002004135653002504155700010904180700009204289700013604381700009104517700008604608773011904694787003304813787001804846787002104864856008804885912001204973914003104985914003705016916001505053917001105068918003605079935002205115949001505137953009105152954006105243955003505304961002205339974001705361983001505378984001505393991572324980742620221123021022.0191214e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063329322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.4202doi  aagid:6332932-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikari, KabindraeauthoruUniversity of Arkansas, Department of Crop, Soil, and Environmental Sciences, Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA10aAssessing soil organic carbon stock of Wisconsin, USA and its fate under future land use and climate change  ap. 833-845.  aCarbon stored in soils contributes to a variety of soil functions, including biomass production, water storage and filtering, biodiversity maintenance, and many other ecosystem services. Understanding soil organic carbon (SOC) spatial distribution and projection of its future condition is essential for future CO2 emission estimates and management options for storing carbon. However, modeling SOC spatiotemporal dynamics is challenging due to the inherent spatial heterogeneity and data limitation. The present study developed a spatially explicit prediction model in which the spatial relationship between SOC observation and seventeen environmental variables was established using the Cubist regression tree algorithm. The model was used to compile a baseline SOC stock map for the top 30 cm soil depth in the State of Wisconsin (WI) at a 90 m × 90 m grid resolution. Temporal SOC trend was assessed by comparing baseline and future SOC stock maps based on the space-for-time substitution model. SOC prediction for future considers land use, precipitation and temperature for the year 2050 at medium (A1B) CO2 emissions scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Field soil observations were related to factors that are known to influence SOC distribution using the digital soil mapping framework. The model was validated on 25% test profiles (R2: 0.38; RMSE: 0.64; ME: −0.03) that were not used during model training that used the remaining 75% of the data (R2: 0.76; RMSE: 0.40; ME: −0.006). In addition, maps of the model error, and areal extent of Cubist prediction rules were reported. The model identified soil parent material and land use as key drivers of SOC distribution including temperature and precipitation. Among the terrain attributes, elevation, mass-balance index, mid-slope position, slope-length factor and wind effect were important. Results showed that Wisconsin soils had an average baseline SOC stock of 90 Mg ha−1 and the distribution was highly variable (CV: 64%). It was estimated that WI soils would have an additional 20 Mg ha−1 SOC by the year 2050 under changing land use and climate. Histosols and Spodosols were expected to lose 19 Mg ha−1 and 4 Mg ha−1, respectively, while Mollisols were expected to accumulate the largest SOC stock (62 Mg ha−1). All land-use types would be accumulating SOC by 2050 except for wetlands (−34 Mg C ha−1). This study found that Wisconsin soils will continue to sequester more carbon in the coming decades and most of the Driftless Area will be sequestering the greatest SOC (+63 Mg C ha−1). Most of the SOC would be lost from the Northern Lakes and Forests ecological zone (−12 Mg C ha−1). The study highlighted areas of potential C sequestration and areas under threat of C loss. The maps generated in this study would be highly useful in farm management and environmental policy decisions at different spatial levels in Wisconsin.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aHistosols 3aMollisols 3aSpodosols 3aalgorithms 3abiodiversity 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental policy 3afarm management 3aforests 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alakes 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil parent materials 3asoil surveys 3aspatial variation 3atemperature 3awater storage 3awetlands 3awind 3aWisconsin 0aDigital soil mapping 0aEnvironmental variables 0aClimate change 0aLand use change 0aCarbon sequestration1 aOwens, Phillip R.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Dale Bumpers Small Farms Research Center, Booneville, AR 72927, USA1 aLibohova, ZamireauthoruUSDA-NRCS, National Soil Survey Center, Lincoln, NE 68508, USA1 aMiller, David M.eauthoruUniversity of Arkansas, Department of Crop, Soil, and Environmental Sciences, Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA1 aWills, Skye A.eauthoruUSDA-NRCS, National Soil Survey Center, Lincoln, NE 68508, USA1 aNemecek, JasoneauthoruUSDA-NRCS, Wisconsin State Office, Madison, WI 53717, USA0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 01, v. 667 p.833-845dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl445540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.4203Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4455b0048-9697  fScience of the total environment  aBatch:2188  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6063329329ExL  a2019-05-07  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/143894218730932306-00001-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0048969719309301.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/NRCSUSDA/ARS  aagid:6332932  a2019-12-14  a2019-12-1401586nab a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024005400097035002800151040001800179072001700197072001700214072001700231100001900248245006200267300001400329650001500343650002100358650001900379650001500398650001500413650002000428700001600448773006600464787003300530787001800563852000900581856010800590912001200698914001700710914001500727917001100742930003300753935002100786945002500807946001300832952005100845961001400896974001700910984001500927985010300942986001201045990002301057991572330830742620221120055828.0090701e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442260122DNAL7 a10.2111/1551-501X(2008)30[52:RACCAS]2.0.CO;22doi  aagid:4008973-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, it remains unclear how climate may affect plant richness across large spatial scales and also over long-terms, for example across massive arid regions during the Quaternary and into the future. To fill this knowledge gap, we examined the long-term trends in plant species richness across vast drylands in China based on our newly developed climate-species richness models. We first generated optimal random forest models based on the relationships between the current (CUR, 1970–2000) annual, perennial, woody and total species richness and climatic variables. We subsequently hindcasted and forecasted plant species richness in five other periods: last interglacial (LIG, 120,000–140,000 years BP), last glacial maximum (LGM, about 22,000 years BP), mid-Holocene (MH, about 6000 years BP), 2041–2060 (2050), and 2061–2080 (2070). Our results showed that total and herbaceous species richness exhibited similar patterns that were driven by temperature and precipitation. Both groups of species formed a transition zone between arid and semi-arid regions in all periods except LIG. In contrast, woody species richness did not form any transition zone because it was regulated mainly by temperature. Furthermore, the mean richness of herbaceous, woody and all species exhibited gradually increasing trends from LIG to 2070 across drylands in China. On the one hand, herbaceous species were much more sensitive to climate change than woody species. On the other hand, plant species richness in mountain-basin systems and Taklamakan Desert regions were more sensitive to climate change than in meadows and steppes. These results shed new insights into the past and future changes in plant species richness over vast drylands and provide valuable information for future conservation efforts under global warming.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aarid lands 3aherbaceous plants 3aspecies richness 3atemperature 3awoody plants 3aChina 0aDrylands 0aGeographical patterns 0aLifeforms 0aPlant species richness 0aRandom forest 0aTemporal variations1 aSun, YuaneauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China1 aYao, ShuraneauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China1 aAkram, Muhammad AdnaneauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China1 aHu, WeigangeauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China1 aDong, LongweieauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China1 aLi, HailingeauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China1 aWei, MaohongeauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China1 aGong, HaiyangeauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China1 aXie, ShubineauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China1 aAqeel, MuhammadeauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China1 aRan, JinzhieauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China1 aDegen, Abraham AllaneauthoruDesert Animal Adaptations and Husbandry, Wyler Department of Dryland Agriculture, Institutes for Desert Research, Ben-Gurion University of Negev, Beer Sheva 8410500, Israel1 aGuo, QinfengeauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Eastern Forest Environmental Threat Assessment Center, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA1 aDeng, JianmingeauthoruState Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Dec., v. 132 p.108288-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)619640uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082883Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:6196b1470-160Xc132e108288  fEcological indicators  aBatch:10203  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6075381859ExL  a2022-02-23  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/179005845031791154-00005-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S1470160X21009535.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7538185  a2021-12-06  a2022-02-1905430nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024001700121024003100138035002800169040001800197100025100215245015800466300001600624506017300640520166100813593001802474593002002492595004902512593002002561650003102581650003002612650001902642650002702661650001502688650002202703650002202725650002102747650001502768650000902783650001102792650001502803650001102818650001702829650002402846650001102870650001102881651001202892700013602904700014003040700015303180700014703333700013803480700014403618773011103762787003303873787001803906787001803924856011403942856007704056912001204133914004004145914004304185916001504228917001104243935002204254949001504276956008304291961000904374962003004383962004804413974001704461983001504478984001504493985011604508986001204624991572386390742620221214231447.0180730e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064724192DNAL7 a10113/64724192hdl7 a2677872aris7 a10.2489/jswc.67.5.3902doi  aagid:6472419-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.eauthoruassistant research scientist at the USDA Agricultural Research Service Southwest Watershed Research Center, Tucson, Arizona, and at the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, China.10aModeling climate change effects on runoff and soil erosion in southeastern Arizona rangelands and implications for mitigation with conservation practices  ap. 390-405.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aClimate change is expected to impact runoff and soil erosion on rangelands in the western United States. This study evaluated the potential impacts of precipitation changes on soil erosion and surface runoff in southeastern Arizona using seven General Circulation Model (GCM) models with three emission scenarios for the 2050s and 2090s. A spatial temporal downscaling process was used to generate daily precipitation series from GCM outputs for runoff and erosion modeling with the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM). Results were compared to 1970 through 1999 conditions. Our results suggested no significant changes in annual precipitation across the region under the three emission scenarios, while projected mean annual runoff and soil loss increased significantly, ranging from 79% to 92% and from 127% to 157%, respectively, relative to 1970 to 1999. At the seasonal scale, though an increase of summer precipitation and a reduction of winter precipitation were projected, both runoff and soil loss increased significantly for both periods. The dramatic increases in runoff and soil loss were attributed to the increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events in the study area. Predicted soil loss from shrub communities increased more than that predicted for other plant communities under the three emission scenarios. Future increases in runoff and soil erosion may accelerate the transitions of grassland to shrublands or to more eroded states due to the positive vegetation-erosion feedback. Rangeland management policies and practices should consider these changes and adapt to the increased risk of runoff and soil erosion.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  blgarnerc2019-06-28dfedoraAdmine2019-06-28  eARIS manuscript 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate change 3aconservation practices 3agrasslands 3aissues and policy 3aplant communities 3arange management 3arangelands 3arisk 3arunoff 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3asoil erosion 3asoil erosion models 3asummer 3awinter 3aArizona1 aHernandez, M.eauthoruhydrologist at the USDA  Agricultural Research Service Southwest Watershed  Research Center, Tucson, Arizona1 aAnson, E.eauthorucomputer specialist at the USDA  Agricultural Research Service Southwest Watershed  Research Center, Tucson, Arizona1 aNearing, M.eauthoruresearch agricultural engineer at the USDA  Agricultural Research Service Southwest Watershed  Research Center, Tucson, Arizona1 aWei, H.eauthoruassistant research scientist at the USDA  Agricultural Research Service Southwest Watershed  Research Center, Tucson, Arizona1 aHeilman, P.eauthoruresearch leader at the USDA  Agricultural Research Service Southwest Watershed  Research Center, Tucson, Arizona1 aStone, J.

To better understand how shifts in both precipitation and semi‐arid vegetation cover alter above‐ground hydrological processes, we assessed how rain interception differs between snow and rain surface water input; how western juniper alters snowpack dynamics; and how these above‐ground processes differ across western juniper, mountain big sagebrush and low sagebrush plant communities. We collected continuous surface water input with four large lysimeters, interspace and below‐canopy snow depth data and conducted periodic snow surveys for two consecutive water years (2013 and 2014). The ratio of interspace to below‐canopy surface water input was greater for snow relative to rain events, averaging 79.4% and 54.8%, respectively. The greater surface water input ratio for snow is in part due to increased deposition of redistributed snow under the canopy. We simulated above‐ground energy and water fluxes in western juniper, low sagebrush and mountain big sagebrush for two 8‐year periods under current and projected mid‐21st century warmer temperatures with the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model. Juniper compared with low and mountain sagebrush reduced surface water input by an average of 138 mm or 24% of the total site water budget. Conversely, warming temperatures reduced surface water input by only an average of 14 mm across the three vegetation types. The future (warmer) simulations resulted in earlier snow disappearance and surface water input by 51 and 45 days, respectively, across juniper, low sagebrush and mountain sagebrush. Information from this study can help land managers in the sagebrush steppe understand how both shifts in climate and semi‐arid vegetation will alter fundamental hydrological processes.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3asnowpack 3avegetation cover 3athroughfall 3asurface water 3aArtemisia rothrockii 3aenergy 3aheat 3amodels 3aclimate change 3asteppes 3atemperature 3asnowmelt 3acanopy 3aplant communities 3alandscapes 3asurveys 3alysimeters 3asemiarid zones 3asnow 3arain 3aArtemisia tridentata 3aWestern United States 0awater balance1 aLink, Timothy E.eauthoruDepartment of Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, 83843, USA1 aSeyfried, Mark S.eauthoruUSDA‐Agricultural Research Service, Northwest Watershed Research Center, Boise, ID, 83712, USA1 aFlerchinger, Gerald N.eauthoruUSDA‐Agricultural Research Service, Northwest Watershed Research Center, Boise, ID, 83712, USA0 tHydrological processes.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 30, no. 17 p.3046-3060dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl393846640uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.108453Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3938466b0885-6087c30d17e3046  fHydrological processes  aBatch:1444  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6054835799ExL  a2016-11-04  a08856087_2016_30_17.xml  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:1444 reviewed on 2016-11-04T08:07:58Z  aagid:5483579  a2016-09-03  a2016-11-0704657nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003800097024002100135035002600156040001800182072000900200072000900209072000900218072000900227072000900236072000900245100002100254245011100275300001600386500002400402520216100426593001802587593002002605650001502625650002002640650002102660650001902681650001602700650001702716650002102733650002502754650002602779650001502805650001702820650002202837650002202859650002202881650002502903651001202928653002402940700002302964700002402987700001603011773011103027787001803138787003303156787003003189787002103219852000903240856011203249856008803361912001203449914004403461914003403505917001103539930003303550935002103583945002503604946001103629949001503640952005103655961001203706974001503718984001503733985010303748986001203851991572764600742620221122053545.0080306e20080210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440245322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2007.08.0132doi7 a10113/292172hdl  aagid:29217-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aB200 0aX200 0aF841 0aX100 0aK0011 aKeane, Robert E.10aClimate change effects on historical range and variability of two large landscapes in western Montana, USA  ap. 375-389.  aIncludes references  aQuantifying the historical range and variability of landscape composition and structure using simulation modeling is becoming an important means of assessing current landscape condition and prioritizing landscapes for ecosystem restoration. However, most simulated time series are generated using static climate conditions which fail to account for the predicted major changes in future climate. This paper presents a simulation study that generates reference landscape compositions for all combinations of three climate scenarios (warm-wet, hot-dry, and current) and three fire regime scenarios (half historical, historical, and double historical fire frequencies) to determine if future climate change has an effect on landscape dynamics. We applied the spatially explicit, state-and-transition, landscape fire succession model LANDSUM to two large landscapes in west-central Montana, USA. LANDSUM was parameterized and initialized using spatial data generated from the LANDFIRE prototype project. Biophysical settings, critical spatial inputs to LANDSUM, were empirically modeled across the landscape using environmental gradients created from historical and modeled future climate daily weather data summaries. Successional pathways and disturbance probabilities were assigned to these biophysical settings based on existing field data and extensive literature reviews. To assess the impact of changes in climate and fire regime, we compared simulated area burned and landscape composition over time among the different simulation scenario combinations using response variables of Sorenson's index (a global measure of similarity) and area occupied by the dominant vegetation class (simple indicator of change in landscape composition). Results show that simulated time series using future predicted climate scenarios are significantly different from the simulated historical time series and any changes in the fire regime tend to create more dissimilar and more variable simulated time series. Our study results indicate that historical time series should be used in conjunction with simulated future time series as references for managing landscapes.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3alandscapes 3aforest habitats 3aclimatic factors 3aclimate change 3afire regime 3aspatial data 3avegetation cover 3avegetation structure 3aecological succession 3atopography 3aforest trees 3astand composition 3alandscape ecology 3asimulation models 3atime series analysis 3aMontana 0avegetation dynamics1 aHolsinger, Lisa M.1 aParsons, Russell A.1 aGray, Kathy0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 Feb. 10, v.  254, no.  3 p.375-389dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl9013  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/292173Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2007.08.0133Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl9013b0378-1127c254d3e375  fForest ecology and management  aissued  a20090526b20090608c00000000  aIND440245329ExL  aINDdLYNe2008/10/23  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20090526 20090608 00000000bIND LYN 2008/10/23  aUSDA/FS  aagid:29217  a2009-06-08  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a402453206051nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003400098024003700132035002800169040001800197100027100215245013900486506007600625506003100701520161900732592002802351593001802379596003202397596004902429596005002478596003602528506003702564650001102601650001902612650002202631650003302653650002902686650001302715650001302728650002202741650001602763650001602779651002602795700024502821700013903066700018403205700014503389700013903534700024903673700017803922700015004100700015004250700015604400700015404556773009804710787003304808787001804841856008004859856004504939912001204984914003504996917001105031918002705042935002205069949001505091955003405106961000905140974001705149983003005166984001505196985010605211991572824270742620221207094812.0220901e20190711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076127942DNAL7 a10.1088/1748-9326/ab31782doi7 a10.1088/1748-9326/ab31782chorus  aagid:7612794-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wen J.eauthoruNortheast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, 130102, People’s Republic of China and School of Natural Resources, University of Missouri, 203 ABNR Bldg, Columbia, MO, 65211, United States of America10aEffects of rising atmospheric CO2, climate change, and nitrogen deposition on aboveground net primary production in a temperate forest  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aTemperate forests regrowing from historical land use and land cover change in the eastern US serve as carbon (C) sinks. Environmental drivers have been significantly altered (e.g. rising atmospheric CO(2) concentration, warmer temperature, and elevated nitrogen (N) deposition) and will have a wide range of impacts on future forest C sinks. However, the interactions among these environmental drivers are unclear and their effects are subject to uncertainty. We assessed the combined and interactive effects of rising CO(2) concentration, climate change (temperature, precipitation), and N deposition on forest aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and their relative contribution to ANPP changes of a temperate forest in the eastern US. We used a process-based ecosystem model PnET-day to simulate coupled cycles of C, water, and N of forest ecosystems. We found that (1) climate change exerted negative effects on ANPP (−0.250 kg C m−2 yr−1) whereas rising CO(2) and N deposition enhanced ANPP (+0.253, +0.014 kg C m−2 yr−1); (2) climate change interacted with rising CO(2) and N deposition to decrease ANPP (−0.032, −0.018 kg C m−2 yr−1); rising CO(2) and N deposition acted in synergy to increase ANPP (+0.014 kg C m−2 yr−1); (3) changes in ANPP were mainly attributed to rising CO(2) and climate change whereas N deposition effects and any two- or three-factor interactive effects were relatively small. Our results suggest that the total negative effect sizes will not be offset by the total positive effect sizes, thus resulting in reductions in forest ANPP over the 21st century.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cChinese Academy of Sciences  cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cUSDA Forest Service Northern Research Station  cUniversity of Missouri-Columbia0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aecological models 3aland use and land cover maps 3anet primary productivity 3anitrogen 3aresearch 3atemperate forests 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3aEastern United States1 aMa, ShuangeauthoruKey Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, People’s Republic of China1 aHe, Hong S.eauthoruSchool of Natural Resources, University of Missouri, 203 ABNR Bldg, Columbia, MO, 65211, United States of America1 aLiu, ZhihuaeauthoruCAS Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, People’s Republic of China1 aThompson, Frank R. llleauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, 202 ABNR Bldg, Columbia, MO, 65211, United States of America1 aJin, WenchieauthoruSchool of Natural Resources, University of Missouri, 203 ABNR Bldg, Columbia, MO, 65211, United States of America1 aWu, Zheng FangeauthoruKey Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, People’s Republic of China1 aSpetich, Martin A.eauthoruArkansas Forestry Science Laboratory, USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, PO Box 1270, Hot Springs, AR 71902 United States of America1 aWang, LeieauthoruNortheast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, 130102, People’s Republic of China1 aXue, SongeauthoruNortheast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, 130102, People’s Republic of China1 aZhang, WenguangeauthoruNortheast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, 130102, People’s Republic of China1 aWang, XianweieauthoruNortheast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, 130102, People’s Republic of China0 tEnvironmental Research Letters.g2019 July 11, v. 14, no. 10dIOP Publishingx1748-93267nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab31783Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7612794  aArticle  fEnvironmental Research Letters  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6076127949ExL  a2022-04-22  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aagid:7612794  a2022-09-01T12:44:59-04:00  a2022-09-28  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl04486nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004200098024002300140024003900163035002800202040001800230100009400248245009500342300001600437520115400453536046201607592002802069593001802097596001402115596001602129596002102145596002302166650001902189650001202208650001102220650001302231650001302244650002002257650001702277650001202294650001302306651001002319653001102329653001502340653002202355653001802377653002902395653002002424700010502444700010902549700009802658773011502756787003302871787001802904787002202922856008602944856011403030912001203144914002103156914003203177916001603209917001103225918004303236935002203279949001503301952001903316953009303335954007203428955004203500961000903542962003003551962004703581962001703628974001703645983001503662984001503677991572840590742620221121004504.0220530e20220504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076127522DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2021.19910662chorus7 a10113/76127522hdl7 a10.1080/08941920.2021.19910662doi  aagid:7612752-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoucy, AlyssaeauthoruSchool of Forest Resources, University of Maine, Orono, Maine, USA10aDrivers of Climate Change Risk Perceptions among Diverse Forest Stakeholders in Maine, USA  ap. 467-486.  aClimate change is impacting forest ecosystems, which support key ecosystem services and the general well-being of natural resource-dependent communities in Northeastern, USA. Understanding the determinants of climate change risk perceptions among forest resource stakeholders is critical to eliciting broad support for adaptation. We examined social-psychological drivers of climate change risk perceptions using hierarchical regression based on an online survey of 211 forest stakeholders, representing a wide range of subsectors, in Maine, USA. Using the climate change risk perceptions model (CCRPM), we explained 70% of the variance in risk perception. Political orientation, belief in climate change, social norms, affect, and experience with weather-related impacts were all significant predictors of perceived risk. Mediation results demonstrate that experience with weather-related impacts influences risk perceptions indirectly via attribution and holistic affect. This study advances our understanding of the social-psychological determinants of climate change risk perceptions, with implications for communication and outreach strategies.  aThis work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire Stennis through the Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment Station under project number ME0-41504; AFRI Agriculture and Natural Resources Science for Climate Variability and Change (AFRI ANRCVC) Challenge Area Program under Grant number 2018-69002-27933; US Forest Service, State and Private Forestry under Grant number 17-DG-11420004-144; and the AVANGRID Foundation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aME0-41504  aAFRI ANRCVC  a2018-69002-27933  a17-DG-11420004-144 3aclimate change 3aforests 3amodels 3aoutreach 3apolitics 3arisk perception 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3avariance 3aMaine 0aAffect 0aexperience 0aforest management 0aforest owners 0asocio-ecological systems 0asurvey research1 aDe Urioste-Stone, SandraeauthoruSchool of Forest Resources, University of Maine, Orono, Maine, USA1 aRahimzadeh-Bajgiran, ParinazeauthoruSchool of Forest Resources, University of Maine, Orono, Maine, USA1 aWeiskittel, AaroneauthoruSchool of Forest Resources, University of Maine, Orono, Maine, USA0 tSociety & natural resources.g2022 May 4, v. 35, no. 5 p.467-486dRoutledgewJournal:jnl45063x1521-07237nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4506340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2021.19910663Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/76127523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl45063  fSociety & natural resources  aBatch:10238  aissued2 aTaylor & Francis Groupeprovider5DNAL  aIND6076127529ExL  a2022-05-17  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/taylorfrancis/usnr20_usnr20.v035.i05_20220530043122#29007518.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/taylorfrancis/08941920.2021.1991066.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/taylorfrancis/  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1521-0723  aMissing ISSN  aagid:7612752  a2022-05-30  a2022-09-0602860nab a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002000097035002500117040001800142100001800160245010000178300001600278500002400294500001500318520095000333593001801283593002001301650002201321650001901343650000901362650003301371650001801404650001501422651001801437653002401455653001401479653004301493653001401536773010701550787001801657787003301675787003001708787001801738852000901756856011101765912001201876914004001888914002601928917001101954930003301965935002101998945001302019946001302032949001502045952004102060961001302101974001402114984001502128985010302143986001202246991573030350742620221122222706.0020415s2001    iau|||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND232653512DNAL7 a10113/66272hdl  aagid:6627-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNearing, M.A.10aPotential changes in rainfall erosivity in the U.S. with climate change during the 21st century  ap. 229-232.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a
The erosive power of rainfall can be expected to change as climate changes. Such erosive changes are likely to have significant impacts on local and national soil conservation strategies. This study uses results of climate change scenarios from two coupled Atmosphere-Ocean Global Climate Models to investigate the possible levels and patterns of change that might be expected over the 21st century. Results of this study suggest the potential for changes in rainfall erosively across much of the continental United States during the coming century. The magnitude of change (positive or negative) across the country over an 80 year period averaged between 16-58%, depending upon the method used to make the predictions. Some areas of the country showed increases and others showed decreases in erosivity. Spatial distributions of calculated erosivity changes indicated areas of both consistency and inconsistency between the two climate models.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3asimulation models 3aclimate change 3arain 3aUniversal Soil Loss Equation 3awater erosion 3aprediction 3aUnited States 0amathematical models 0aequations 0aatmosphere-ocean global climate models 0aerosivity0 tJournal of soil and water conservation.g2001, v.  56, no.  3 p.229-232wJournal:1947x0022-45617nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)1947  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/66273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:1947b0022-4561c56d3e229  fJ. soil water conserv  aissued  a20071116b20071210c00000000  aIND232653519ExL  aINDdCMS  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20071116 20071210 00000000bIND CMS   aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6627  a2007-12-10  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a353077203911nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003800097024002000135035002500155040001800180072000900198072000900207072000900216100001700225245010000242300001600342500002400358500001500382520164000397593001802037650001802055650001302073650001602086650002202102650002402124650003702148650001902185650001502204650002202219650001702241650001902258650001602277650001802293650001502311651002902326653001802355653002402373700001802397700001702415700001902432700001802451773006002469787001802529787003002547787003302577852000902610856011102619856008802730912001202818914001102830917001102841930003302852935002102885945002502906946001102931949001502942952005102957961001303008974001403021984001503035985010303050986001203153991573095390742620221120192814.0071113e20050630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439781732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2005.03.0032doi7 a10113/67892hdl  aagid:6789-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aJ800 0aJ7001 aO'Neal, M.R.10aClimate change impacts on soil erosion in Midwest United States with changes in crop management  ap. 165-184.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study investigates potential changes in erosion rates in the Midwestern United States under climate change, including the adaptation of crop management to climate change. Previous studies of erosion under climate change have not taken into account farmer choices of crop rotations or planting dates, which will adjust to compensate for climate change. In this study, changes in management were assigned based on previous studies of crop yield, optimal planting date, and most profitable rotations under climate change in the Midwestern United States. Those studies predicted future shifts from maize and wheat to soybeans based on price and yield advantages to soybeans. In the results of our simulations, for 10 of 11 regions of the study area runoff increased from + 10% to + 310%, and soil loss increased from + 33% to + 274%, in 2040-2059 relative to 1990-1999. Soil loss changes were more variable compared to studies that did not take into account changes in management. Increased precipitation and decreasing cover from temperature-stressed maize were important factors in the results. The soil erosion model appeared to underestimate the impact of change in crop type, particularly to soybeans, meaning that erosion increases could be even higher than simulated. This research shows that future crop management changes due to climate and economics can affect the magnitude of erosional impacts beyond that which would be predicted from direct climate change alone. Prediction of future soil erosion can help in the management of valuable cropland and suggest the need for continually changing soil conservation strategies.  aPubAg article 3aplanting date 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3asimulation models 3aagricultural runoff 3aWater Erosion Prediction Project 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3aTriticum aestivum 3asoil erosion 3aclimate models 3atemperature 3acrop rotation 3aprediction 3aMidwestern United States 0aprecipitation 0asoil erosion models1 aNearing, M.A.1 aVining, R.C.1 aSouthworth, J.1 aPfeifer, R.A.0 tCatena.g2005 June 30, v.  61, no.  2-3 p.165-1847nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/67893Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2005.03.0033Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fCatena  aissued  a20071116b20071210c00000000  aIND439781739ExL  aINDdLYNe2007/11/16  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20071116 20071210 00000000bIND LYN 2007/11/16  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6789  a2007-12-10  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a397817304523nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003800097024002000135035002500155040001800180072000900198072000900207072000900216072000900225072000900234100001600243245009700259300001600356500002400372500001500396520224300411593001802654650002302672650001702695650002202712650001902734650002102753650001502774650002502789650003702814650001102851650001902862650001502881650002202896650001702918650001602935650001102951651001302962653001802975653002502993653003303018700001803051773006003069787001803129787003003147787003303177852000903210856011103219856008803330912001203418914001103430917001103441930003303452935002103485945002503506946001103531949001503542952005103557961001303608974001403621984001503635985010303650986001203753991573100710742620221121015846.0071113e20050630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439782022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2005.03.0092doi7 a10113/67902hdl  aagid:6790-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aX100 0aF120 0aJ700 0aB2001 aZhang, X.C.10aImpact of climate change on soil erosion, runoff, and wheat productivity in central Oklahoma  ap. 185-195.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe potential for global climate changes to increase the risk of soil erosion is clear, but the actual damage is not. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on soil erosion, surface runoff, and wheat productivity in central Oklahoma. Monthly projections were used from the Hadley Centre's general circulation model, HadCM3, using scenarios A2a, B2a, and GGa1 for the periods of 1950-1999 and 2070-2099. Projected changes in monthly precipitation and temperature distributions between the two periods were incorporated into daily weather series by means of a stochastic weather generator (CLIGEN) with its input parameters adjusted to each scenario. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was run for four climate scenarios including a recent historical climate and three tillage systems (conventional tillage, conservation tillage, and no-till). HadCM3-projected mean annual precipitation during 2070-2099 at El Reno, Oklahoma decreased by 13.6%, 7.2%, and 6.2% for A2a, B2a, and GGa1, respectively; and mean annual temperature increased by 5.7, 4.0, and 4.7 °C, respectively. Predicted average annual soil loss in the tillage systems other than no-till, compared with historical climate (1950-1999), increased by 18-30% for A2a, remained similar for B2a, and increased by 67-82% for GGa1. Predicted soil loss in no-till did not increase in the three scenarios. Predicted mean annual runoff in all three tillage systems increased by 16-25% for A2a, remained similar for B2a, and increased by 6-19% for GGa1. The greater increases in soil loss and runoff in GGa1 were attributed to greater variability in monthly precipitation as projected by HadCM3. The increased variability led to increased frequency of large storms. Small changes in wheat yield, which ranged from a 5% decrease in B2a to a 5% increase in GGa1, were because the adverse effects of the temperature increase on winter wheat growth were largely offset by CO2 rise as well as the bulky decrease in precipitation occurred outside the growing season. The overall results indicate that no-till and conservation tillage systems will be effective in combating soil erosion under projected climates in central Oklahoma.  aPubAg article 3atemporal variation 3awinter wheat 3asimulation models 3acarbon dioxide 3agreenhouse gases 3ano-tillage 3aconventional tillage 3aWater Erosion Prediction Project 3ayields 3aclimate change 3awatersheds 3aTriticum aestivum 3asoil erosion 3atemperature 3arunoff 3aOklahoma 0aprecipitation 0aconservation tillage 0aHadley Centre model (HadCM3)1 aNearing, M.A.0 tCatena.g2005 June 30, v.  61, no.  2-3 p.185-1957nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/67903Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2005.03.0093Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fCatena  aissued  a20071116b20071210c00000000  aIND439782029ExL  aINDdLYNe2007/11/16  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20071116 20071210 00000000bIND LYN 2007/11/16  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6790  a2007-12-10  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a397820203565nab a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100013300180245016200313300001100475520119500486592002801681593001801709650001101727650001201738650001901750650002001769650002101789650001101810650001601821650001201837700013001849700010301979700013002082700012802212773011302340787003302453787001802486787002102504856008202525912001202607914004502619914002002664916001602684917001102700918002902711935002202740949001502762953006702777954005902844955003702903961001202940974001702952983001502969984001502984991573123620742620221123003812.0221001e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075489162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-021-03242-62doi  aagid:7548916-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSloggy, Matthew R.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Service, Riverside, CA, USA. matthew.sloggy@usda.gov10aChanging opinions on a changing climate: the effects of natural disasters on public perceptions of climate change [Erratum: September 2022, v.174(1-2); p.17]  ap. 25.  aThe frequency and intensity of natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods are predicted to change as greenhouse gas concentrations increase. These disasters may represent sources of information for individuals as they update their beliefs related to climate change. Using a dataset that includes climate beliefs of respondents, we examine the effect of natural disasters on climate change beliefs and find that hurricanes significantly increase the probability that survey respondents from a given county believe that climate change is occurring and that it is human caused. We find that past experience with certain types of natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes) impacts beliefs regarding whether climate change is occurring and if it is human caused. The research contributes to the literature evaluating climate change attitudes by using spatially disaggregate information on climate change beliefs and exposure to a set of natural disasters over time. Characterizing beliefs and attitudes toward climate change and related policies is important since these beliefs are a determinant of individual adaptation and support for policies related to reducing carbon emissions.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3agreenhouse gases 3ahumans 3aprobability 3asurveys1 aSuter, Jordan F.eauthoruDepartment of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA1 aRad, Mani RouhieauthoruDepartment of Agricultural Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA1 aManning, Dale T.eauthoruDepartment of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA1 aGoemans, ChriseauthoruDepartment of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA0 tClimatic change.g2021 Oct., v. 168, no. 3-4 p.25-25dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03242-63Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c168d3-4e25  fClimatic change  aBatch:10203  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6075489169ExL  a2022-02-23  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_22-10-01_05-36-59.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-168-3-4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7548916  a2022-10-01  a2022-10-0304975nab a2200865 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003000121024003300151035002800184040001800212100016000230245010200390300001800492506007600510506003100586506002800617506005700645520142400702592002802126593001802154596000902172596000802181506003702189650001102226650001902237650002502256650001702281650002702298650001102325650001902336650000902355650001302364650001602377650000902393650001302402650001502415650001202430650001802442650001702460650001702477651000902494700008402503700008202587700008902669700008802758700007702846700008702923700014903010700009703159773013603256787003303392787001803425787002203443856011403465856007603579912001203655914003403667914002903701916001603730917001103746918002703757935002203784949001503806955003403821961000903855962003003864962004703894974001703941983003003958984001503988985010604003991573271360742620221215142404.0220901e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073386032DNAL7 a10113/73386032hdl7 a10.1029/2018wr0234682doi7 a10.1029/2018wr0234682chorus  aagid:7338603-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLove, D.

The model simulated the relationship between water supply to the root zone versus canopy transpiration and assimilation over a growing season. Canopy flux thresholds were identified that distinguished nonstressed, stressed, and dying stands. We found growing season rain and local soil moisture were insufficient for the survival of 5 of 10 stands. Six stands required a substantial subsidy (31–80% of potential seasonal transpiration) to avoid water stress and maximize photosynthetic potential. Subsidy dependence increased with stand hydraulic conductance. Four of the six “subsidized” stands were predicted to be stressed during the survey year owing to a subsidy shortfall. Since winter snowpack is closely related to groundwater recharge in the region, we compared winter precipitation with tree‐ring chronologies. Consistent with model predictions, chronologies were more sensitive to snowpack in subsidized stands than in nonsubsidized ones. The results imply that aspen stand health in the region is more coupled to winter snowpack than to growing season water supply. Winters are predicted to have less precipitation as snow, indicating a stressful future for the region's aspen forests.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA  cNSF0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3agroundwater recharge 3agrowth rings 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3arain 3aresearch 3arhizosphere 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asoil water 3asurveys 3atranspiration 3awater stress 3awater supply 3aUtah1 aVenturas, M.

Development of strategies to mitigate the impact of these projected changes on agricultural production and environmental quality is important for ensuring agricultural resiliency to future climate. This study used the DRAINMOD hydrologic model to simulate subsurface drainage discharge at a field site in the headwaters of the Western Lake Erie Basin using future climate patterns projected by 20 general circulation models. Despite projected increases in rainfall, by the late twenty-first century, subsurface discharge was projected to decrease 7% and 11% under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Reductions in subsurface discharge were attributed to increased temperature and evapotranspiration. The performance of controlled drainage was not projected to change on an annual basis throughout the next century. The benefits of controlled drainage systems as an agricultural best management practice were still evident under the projected climate change of the next century. The role of controlled drainage as a means to potentially retain more crop available water in the soil profile could become critically important under future climate conditions.  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article  bllucasc2017-09-22dmanager-lgarnere2017-09-26  eARIS manuscript 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3abasins 3abest management practices 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aenvironmental quality 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic models 3aplant available water 3aprediction 3arain 3asimulation models 3asoil profiles 3asubsurface drainage 3atemperature 3aLake Erie 3aUnited States1 aFausey, Norman R.eauthoruSoil Drainage Research Unit, USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Columbus, Ohio1 aMartin, Jay F.eauthoruDepartment of  Food, Agricultural, and Biological  Engineering, and Ohio Sea  Grant Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio1 aBrown, Larry C.eauthoruDepartment of Food, Agricultural, and Biological Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio0 tJournal of soil and water conservation.g2017 , v. 72, no. 3 p.240-250wJournal:1947x0022-45617nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)194740uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/58018543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.72.3.240  aArticle  aJournal:1947c72d3e240  fJournal of soil and water conservation  aBatch:1834  aissued  aIND6058018549ExL  a2017-11-02  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/330640.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:1834 reviewed on 2017-11-02T13:15:02Z  aagid:5801854  a2017-08-19  a2017-11-02  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans1312204735nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100019800180245010500378300001200483500001100495520162700506592002802133593001802161596004602179596004602225596004602271596004602317596004602363596004602409596004602455650001902501650002202520650001402542650001202556650001502568651001102583651001902594651001802613700010502631700011102736700012302847700013302970700012803103700012503231773013503356787003303491787001803524787002403542856008303566912001203649914004603661914003403707916001503741917001103756918002903767935002203796949001503818953006703833954005603900955003703956961000903993974001704002983001504019984001504034991573751860742620221120035220.0201230e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071800062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-020-01721-72doi  aagid:7180006-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarshall, Adrienne M.eauthoruDepartment of Forest, Rangeland and Fire Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, 83843, USA. adriennemarshall@uidaho.edu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5555-254810aClimate change literature and information gaps in mountainous headwaters of the Columbia River Basin  ap. 134.  aReview  aClimate change is altering mountainous headwaters and the biophysical and social systems that depend on them. While scientific knowledge on climate change abounds, literature syntheses are needed to understand the multidisciplinary impacts, identify critical knowledge gaps, and assess potential management and policy responses. In this study, we systematically map and analyze the topical and spatial distribution of climate change research in the mountainous headwaters of a major transboundary watershed, the Columbia River Basin (CRB). We find that climate change research in the CRB focuses on impacts much more frequently than adaptation, while mitigation is rarely a focus. Most studies assess trends at large spatial extents, use secondary data, and make projections of climate change impacts rather than observations. The spatial distribution and thematic content of research vary across an international border, with greater concentrations of research in the USA than Canada. A general scarcity of social science research and limited interaction between social and biophysical content reinforce the need for increased collaboration between disparate disciplines. Future research focus areas should include research related to climate change adaptation and mitigation, increased integration between social and biophysical sciences, and collaborations that bridge the international border for a more unified basin-wide focus. Focusing on these new directions for research will increase the potential for science and management communities to co-produce actionable science and effective responses to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a1249400cNational Science Foundation (US)  a1249400cNational Science Foundation (US)  a1249400cNational Science Foundation (US)  a1249400cNational Science Foundation (US)  a1249400cNational Science Foundation (US)  a1249400cNational Science Foundation (US)  a1249400cNational Science Foundation (US) 3aclimate change 3aissues and policy 3amountains 3asociety 3awatersheds 3aCanada 3aColumbia River 3aUnited States1 aFoard, MeghaneauthoruWater Resources Graduate Program, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, 83843, USA1 aCooper, Courtney M.eauthoruWater Resources Graduate Program, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, 83843, USA1 aEdwards, PariseauthoruUSDA Northwest Climate Hub, USDA Pacific Northwest Research Station, Corvallis, OR, 97331, USA1 aHirsch, Shana L.eauthoruDepartment of Human Centered Design and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA1 aRussell, MicaheauthoruDepartment of Environment and Sustainability, Western Colorado University, Gunnison, CO, 81231, USA1 aLink, Timothy E.eauthoruDepartment of Forest, Rangeland and Fire Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, 83843, USA0 tRegional environmental change.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 4 p.134-134dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)J00000030340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01721-73Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:J000000303b1436-3798c20d4e134  fRegional environmental change  aBatch:2628  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6071800069ExL  a2020-12-24  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_20-12-30_05-10-11.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10113-20-4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA  aagid:7180006  a2020-12-30  a2020-12-3003752nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002300115024002400138024001200162035002800174040001800202100008400220245010400304300001600408506017300424520087000597592002801467593001801495593002001513650001901533650001901552650002401571650002301595650001101618650001501629650002001644650001101664650001201675651001801687700002701705700003001732700002601762700002501788700002601813700002701839700002901866700002601895700002301921700002901944700002801973700002802001773012902029787003302158787001802191787001902209856011402228856007102342912001202413914004102425914004502466916001502511917001102526918004302537935002202580949001502602953002702617956008302644956008502727961000902812962004802821962003002869974001702899983001502916984001502931986001202946991573858980742620221214225322.0160205e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048153402DNAL7 a2933702aris7 a10113/48153402hdl7 a10.1890/1203122doi8 ans16397  aagid:4815340-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Erik JeauthoruDepartment of Economics, Bowdoin College, Brunswick, ME10aClimate change's impact on key ecosystem services and the human well‐being they support in the US  ap. 483-893.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aClimate change alters the functions of ecological systems.

Climate models portend continued warming and more frequent extreme weather events across the US. Such weather‐related disturbances will place a premium on the ecosystem services that people rely on. We discuss some of the observed and anticipated impacts of climate change on ecosystem service provision and livelihoods in the US. We also highlight promising adaptive measures. The challenge will be choosing which adaptive strategies to implement, given limited resources and time. We suggest using dynamic balance sheets or accounts of natural capital and natural assets to prioritize and evaluate national and regional adaptation strategies that involve ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aecological function 3aecosystem services 3ahumans 3alivelihood 3anatural capital 3apeople 3aweather 3aUnited States1 aKareiva, Petereauthor1 aRuckelshaus, Maryeauthor1 aArkema, Katieeauthor1 aGeller, Garyeauthor1 aGirvetz, Evaneauthor1 aGoodrich, Daveeauthor1 aMatzek, Virginiaeauthor1 aPinsky, Malineauthor1 aReid, Walteauthor1 aSaunders, Martineauthor1 aSemmens, Dariuseauthor1 aTallis, Heathereauthor0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2013 Nov., v. 11, no. 9 p.483-893dEcological Society of Americax1540-92957nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2308340uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/48153403Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1203123Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:23083b1540-9295c11d9e483  fFrontiers in ecology and the environment  aBatch:1395  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6048153409ExL  a2019-06-18  a15409295_2013_11_9.xml  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2205.pdf  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2205_0.pdf  aUSDA  aBatch:1395 reviewed on 2016-08-18T11:00:02Z  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aagid:4815340  a2016-02-05  a2019-06-18  ans1639705355nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100013200179245008000311300001300391500001100404520187600415592002802291593001802319650001102337650001202348650001802360650001902378650001202397650001302409650001102422650002602433650000902459650001302468650002302481650001102504650001002515650002002525650001602545650001402561650001002575650001102585650000902596700012602605700013202731700013102863700013302994700013003127700013603257700017303393700012603566700009603692700014903788773010603937787003304043787001804076787002204094856008204116912001204198914004204210914001004252916001504262917001104277918002904288935002204317949001504339953006704354954005604421955003704477961001204514974001704526983001504543984001504558991574647460742620221120203504.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058925482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-017-1587-62doi  aagid:5892548-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBegum, ShahanaraeauthoruFaculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan10aClimate change and the regulation of wood formation in trees by temperature  ap. 3-15.  aReview  aKEY MESSAGE : A better understanding of the influence of environmental conditions on wood formation should help to improve the radial growth of trees and to prepare for climate change. The cambial activity of trees is associated with seasonal cycles of activity and dormancy in temperate zones. The timing of cambial reactivation in early spring and dormancy in autumn plays an important role in determination of the cambial growth and the environmental adaptivity of temperate trees. This review focuses on the temperature regulation of the timing of cambial reactivation and xylem differentiation and highlights recent advances of bud growth in relation to cambial activity of temperate trees. In addition, we discuss relationships between the timing of cambial reactivation, start of xylem differentiation and changes in levels of storage materials to identify the source of the energy required for cell division and differentiation. We also present a summary of current understanding of the effects of rapid increases and decreases in temperature on cambial activity, by localized heating and cooling, respectively. Increases in temperature from late winter to early spring influence the physiological processes that are involved in the initiation of cambial reactivation and xylem differentiation both in localized heated stems and under natural conditions. Localized cooling has a direct effect on cell expansion, the thickening of walls of differentiating tracheids, and the rate of division of cambial cells. A rapid decrease in temperature of the stem might be the critical factor in the control of latewood formation and the cessation of cambial activity. Therefore, temperature is the main driver of cambial activity in temperate trees and trees are able to feel changes in temperature through the stem. The climate change might affect wood formation in trees.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aautumn 3acambium 3acell division 3aclimate change 3acooling 3adormancy 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aheat 3alatewood 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3astems 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3atracheids 3atrees 3awinter 3awood1 aKudo, KayoeauthoruFaculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan1 aRahman, MdHasnateauthoruFaculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan1 aNakaba, SatoshieauthoruFaculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan1 aYamagishi, YusukeeauthoruFaculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan1 aNabeshima, ErieauthoruFaculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan1 aNugroho, WidyantoDwieauthoruFaculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan1 aOribe, YuichiroeauthoruTohoku Regional Breeding Office, Forest Tree Breeding Center, Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, Takizawa, Iwate, 020-0173, Japan1 aKitin, PetereauthoruForest Products Laboratory, USDA Forest Service, One Gifford Pinchot Drive, Madison, WI, 53726, USA1 aJin, Hyun-OeauthoruCollege of Life Sciences, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, 446-701, Korea1 aFunada, RyoeauthoruFaculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan. funada@cc.tuat.ac.jp0 tTrees.g2018 Feb., v. 32, no. 1 p.3-15dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl43090x0931-18907nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4309040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-017-1587-63Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl43090b0931-1890c32d1e3  fTrees  aBatch:1974  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6058925489ExL  a2018-06-19  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-02-08_06-19-37.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/00468-32-1.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:5892548  a2018-06-19  a2018-06-1902361nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008003300034016002200067024002100089035002600110040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001900190245014400209500002400353500001500377593001800392594002200410650002900432650002400461650001500485650002000500650003500520650001700555650001700572650002200589650001900611650002200630650001300652650002300665651001500688653001700703653001500720653000900735653001600744653001600760653002100776700001900797700001800816700002100834773013600855787001800991787003301009852000901042856011201051912001201163914010401175917001101279930003301290935002101323945002501344946001101369949001501380952005101395961001301446974001501459979002301474984001501497985010301512986001201615991574778010742620221121041116.0080205|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND440105592DNAL7 a10113/161352hdl  aagid:16135-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ400 0aX620 0aX200 0aJ2001 aVenteris, E.R.13aAn assessment of the potential use of SRTM DEMs in terrain analysis for the efficient mapping of soils in the drylands region of Kazakhstan  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article 3adigital elevation models 3asoil organic carbon 3aarid lands 3asoil properties 3ageographic information systems 3asoil surveys 3aspatial data 3acomputer analysis 3aremote sensing 3acomputer software 3aInternet 3alandscape position 3aKazakhstan 0aterrain data 0atopography 0asoil 0amethodology 0anew methods 0aterrain analysis1 aPachikin, K.M.1 aMcCarty, G.W.1 aDoraiswamy, P.C.0 tClimate change and terrestrial carbon sequestration in Central Asia /  editors, R.

The simulations suggest that annual net uptake (net ecosystem production (NEP)) for the whole forested region (8.2 million hectares) was 13.8 Tg C (168 g C m-2 yr-1), with the highest mean uptake in the Coast Range ecoregion (226 g C m-2 yr-1), and the lowest mean NEP in the East Cascades (EC) ecoregion (88 g C m-2 yr-1). Carbon stocks totaled 2765 Tg C (33 700 g C m-2), with wide variability among ecoregions in the mean stock and in the partitioning above- and belowground. The flux of carbon from the land to the atmosphere that is driven by wildfire was relatively low during the late 1990s (approximately 0.1 Tg C yr-1), however, wildfires in 2002 generated a much larger C source (approximately 4.1 Tg C). Annual harvest removals from the study area over the period 1995-2000 were approximately 5.5 Tg C yr-1. The removals were disproportionately from the Coast Range, which is heavily managed for timber production (approximately 50% of all of Oregon's forest land has been managed for timber in the past 5 years). The estimate for the annual increase in C stored in long-lived forest products and land fills was 1.4 Tg C yr-1. Net biome production (NBP) on the land, the net effect of NEP, harvest removals, and wildfire emissions indicates that the study area was a sink (8.2 Tg C yr-1). NBP of the study area, which is the more heavily forested half of the state, compensated for approximately 52% of Oregon's fossil carbon dioxide emissions of 15.6 Tg C yr-1 in 2000. The Biscuit Fire in 2002 reduced NBP dramatically, exacerbating net emissions that year. The regional total reflects the strong east-west gradient in potential productivity associated with the climatic gradient, and a disturbance regime that has been dominated in recent decades by commercial forestry.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aprimary productivity 3asoil organic carbon 3aleaf area index 3avegetation cover 3acarbon sequestration 3aremote sensing 3asource-sink relationships 3aconiferous forests 3aforest stands 3aforest fires 3asimulation models 3aclimate change 3aspatial data 3aspatial variation 3aclimatic factors 3aecoregions 3aage structure 3aglobal carbon budget 3adata analysis 3aCascade Mountain region 3aOregon 0aBiome-BGC model 0aKlamath mountains (Oregon) 0abiogeochemical cycles 0aCoast Range (Oregon) 0amicrometeorology 0aBisquit Fire (Oregon)1 aTurner, D.1 aCampbell, J.1 aSun, O.J.1 aVan Tuyl, S.1 aRitts, W.D.1 aCohen, W.B.0 tGlobal change biology.g2004 Sept., v.  10, no.  9 p.1429-1444x1354-10137nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl57021  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00822.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/407743Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c10d9e1429  fGlobal change biology  aissued  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aIND437025919ExL  aINDdLYNe2010/04/23  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20100423 20100501 00000000bIND LYN 2010/04/23  aUSDA/FS  aagid:40774  a2011-03-19  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a370259104305nab a2200853 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004200097024002100139035002600160040001800186072000900204072000900213072000900222072000900231100001700240245013200257300001800389500002400407500001500431520169200446593001802138593002002156650001902176650002102195650002502216650001702241650001902258650001302277650002102290650001302311650002402324650001602348650002002364650001702384650001602401650002102417650001502438650001602453650001702469650001302486650002302499651001102522653002302533653001902556653001802575700001602593700001702609700001702626773008402643787001802727787003302745787003002778787002202808852000902830856009202839856011202931912001203043914004603055914002603101917001103127930003303138935002103171945002503192946001103217949001503228952005103243961001203294974001503306984001503321985010303336986001203439991574833810742620221122053310.0050517e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437025632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00826.x2doi7 a10113/407732hdl  aagid:40773-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aB200 0aK250 0aX1001 aWilmking, M.10aRecent climate warming forces contrasting growth responses of white spruce at treeline in Alaska through temperature thresholds  ap. 1724-1736.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aNorthern and high-latitude alpine treelines are generally thought to be limited by available warmth. Most studies of tree-growth–climate interaction at treeline as well as climate reconstructions using dendrochronology report positive growth response of treeline trees to warmer temperatures. However, population-wide responses of treeline trees to climate remain largely unexamined. We systematically sampled 1558 white spruce at 13 treeline sites in the Brooks Range and Alaska Range. Our findings of both positive and negative growth responses to climate warming at treeline challenge the widespread assumption that arctic treeline trees grow better with warming climate. High mean temperatures in July decreased the growth of 40% of white spruce at treeline areas in Alaska, whereas warm springs enhance growth of additional 36% of trees and 24% show no significant correlation with climate. Even though these opposing growth responses are present in all sampled sites, their relative proportion varies between sites and there is no overall clear relationship between growth response and landscape position within a site. Growth increases and decreases appear in our sample above specific temperature index values (temperature thresholds), which occurred more frequently in the late 20th century. Contrary to previous findings, temperature explained more variability in radial growth after 1950. Without accounting for these opposite responses and temperature thresholds, climate reconstructions based on ring width will miscalibrate past climate, and biogeochemical and dynamic vegetation models will overestimate carbon uptake and treeline advance under future warming scenarios.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aboreal forests 3acluster analysis 3acarbon sequestration 3aPicea glauca 3aglobal warming 3atreeline 3adendrochronology 3aaltitude 3apopulation dynamics 3acorrelation 3amontane forests 3aforest trees 3atemperature 3aclimatic factors 3aprediction 3atree growth 3agrowth rings 3alatitude 3alandscape position 3aAlaska 0apopulation ecology 0aclimate change 0aradial growth1 aJuday, G.P.1 aBarber, V.A.1 aZald, H.S.J.0 tGlobal change biology.g2004 Oct., v.  10, no.  10 p.1724-1736x1354-10137nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl57021  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00826.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/407733Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c10d10e1724  fGlobal change biology  aissued  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aIND437025639ExL  aINDdLYNe2010/04/23  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20100423 20100501 00000000bIND LYN 2010/04/23  aUSDA/FS  aagid:40773  a2010-05-01  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a370256303288nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004200097024002100139035002600160040001800186072000900204072000900213072000900222072000900231072000900240100001900249245012100268300001800389500002400407520091400431593001801345593002001363650001901383650000901402650001501411650001501426650002401441650002301465650001901488650002501507650002101532650001901553650001801572650001201590651001101602700002101613700002201634700002601656700002701682773010901709787001801818787003301836787003001869787002201899852000901921856009201930856011202022912001202134914004502146914002602191917001102217930003302228935002102261945002502282946001102307949001502318952005102333961001302384974001502397984001502412985010302427986001202530991574896310742620221120112233.0080606e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440643742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01605.x2doi7 a10113/409792hdl  aagid:40979-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aJ100 0aF600 0aJ200 0aF3001 aFay, Philip A.10aChanges in grassland ecosystem function due to extreme rainfall events: implications for responses to climate change  ap. 1600-1608.  aIncludes references  aClimate change is causing measurable changes in rainfall patterns, and will likely cause increases in extreme rainfall events, with uncertain implications for key processes in ecosystem function and carbon cycling.

Considerable increases in yield are required over this century to continue feeding the world's growing population. This meta-analysis synthesizes the research to date on rice responses to two elements of global change, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO₂]) and rising tropospheric ozone concentration ([O₃]). On an average, elevated [CO₂] (627 ppm) increased rice yields by 23%. Modest increases in grain mass and larger increases in panicle and grain number contributed to this response. The response of rice to elevated [CO₂] varied with fumigation technique. The more closely the fumigation conditions mimicked field conditions, the smaller was the stimulation of yield by elevated [CO₂]. Free air concentration enrichment (FACE) experiments showed only a 12% increase in rice yield. The rise in atmospheric [CO₂] will be accompanied by increases in tropospheric O₃ and temperature. When compared with rice grown in charcoal-filtered air, rice exposed to 62 ppb O₃ showed a 14% decrease in yield. Many determinants of yield, including photosynthesis, biomass, leaf area index, grain number and grain mass, were reduced by elevated [O₃]. While there have been too few studies of the interaction of CO₂ and O₃ for meta-analysis, the interaction of temperature and CO₂ has been studied more widely. Elevated temperature treatments negated any enhancement in rice yield at elevated [CO₂], which suggests that identifying high temperature tolerant germplasm will be key to realizing yield benefits in the future.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aclimate change 3acarbon dioxide 3aozone 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3agrain yield 3abiomass 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaf area index 3ameta-analysis0 tGlobal change biology.g2008 July, v.  14, no.  7 p.1642-1650dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl57021  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01594.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/409763Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c14d7e1642  fGlobal change biology  aissued  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aIND440643789ExL  aINDdGAYe2010/04/28  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20100428 20100501 00000000bIND GAY 2010/04/28  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:40976  a2010-05-01  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a406437804315nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003100097024002100128035002600149040001800175072000900193072000900202072000900211072000900220100001200229245005500241300001600296500002400312520198900336593001802325593002002343650001902363650002002382650002902402650002002431650002502451650002202476650002302498650001802521650002002539650002902559650002102588650002802609653002302637700001802660700001902678700001502697700001302712700001302725773010802738787001802846787003302864787003002897787001802927852000902945856008102954856011203035912001203147914004003159914004303199917001103242930003303253935002103286945002503307946001303332949001503345952005103360961001303411974001503424984001503439985010303454986001203557991574939540742620221120121721.0110926e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446184942DNAL7 a10.2489/jswc.66.4.2762doi7 a10113/504002hdl  aagid:50400-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aJ800 0aJ710 0aF1001 aLal, R.10aManagement to mitigate and adapt to climate change  ap. 276-285.  aIncludes references  aManagement decisions both at the field and off-site have the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Climate change threatens to increase the potential for soil erosion, reduce soil quality, lower agricultural productivity and negatively impact food security and global sustainability, making it one of the most severe challenges we will face in the 21st century. This paper looks at the potential of management to help us, not only mitigate climate change, but also to help us adapt to a changing climate. Different aspects of carbon management, nitrogen management, manure management, management in low-input systems (sustainable agriculture), and grazing land management are discussed as examples. Management decisions regarding conservation practices, such as no-till, conservation agriculture, and returning crop residue to the field to increase nutrient cycling, can contribute to carbon sequestration and help us mitigate and adapt to climate change. Additionally, management of grasslands, restoration of degraded/desertified lands, nitrogen management to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, precision conservation management at a field and/or watershed level, and other management alternatives can also help us mitigate and/or adapt to climate change. Management for climate change mitigation and adaptation is key for environmental conservation, sustainability of cropping systems, soil and water quality, and food security. This paper suggests, based on a review of the literature, that management decisions that reduce soil erosion, increase carbon sequestration to improve soil functions, soil quality, and soil health, and contribute to the resilience of soils and cropping systems will be needed to respond to climate change and related challenges such as food security. Our review suggests that without management decisions that increase soil and water conservation, food security for the world's growing population will be harder to achieve.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3asoil management 3acarbon sequestration 3asoil conservation 3awater conservation 3agrazing lands 3aland management 3aanimal manure management 3acropping systems 3asustainable agriculture 0aliterature reviews1 aDelgado, J.A.1 aGroffman, P.M.1 aMillar, N.1 aDell, C.1 aRotz, A.0 tJournal of soil and water conservation.g2011 , v.  66, no.  4 p.276-285wJournal:1947x0022-45617nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)1947  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.66.4.2763Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/504003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:1947b0022-4561c66d4e276  fJournal of soil and water conservation  aissued  a20111006b20111104c00000000  aIND446184949ExL  aINDdGAYe2011/10/06  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20111006 20111104 00000000bIND GAY 2011/10/06  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:50400  a2012-06-07  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a461849403652nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002900098024002600127024003300153035002800186040001800214100011000232245011300342300001400455500002000469500001500489506002800504506003000532520113800562592002801700593001801728596004401746596004501790506003701835650001001872650001501882650003301897650001901930650002201949650001001971650001301981650001901994650001602013650002102029650001902050650001402069650001202083650001202095651003102107653001502138700012902153773013502282787003302417787001802450787001902468856007202487903002202559912001202581914004002593914004502633916001502678917001102693918004302704935002202747949001502769953002702784961001202811962004802823974001702871983001502888984001502903991575126510742620221207080616.0180226e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058978042DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.14452chorus7 a10.1002/fee.14452doi7 a10.1002/fee.14452chorusOpen  aagid:5897804-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradford, John BeauthoruSouthwest Biological Science Center, US Geological Survey (USGS), Flagstaff, AZ12aA window of opportunity for climate‐change adaptation: easing tree mortality by reducing forest basal area  ap. 11-17.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aIncreasing aridity as a result of climate change is expected to exacerbate tree mortality. Reducing forest basal area – the cross‐sectional area of tree stems within a given ground area – can decrease tree competition, which may reduce drought‐induced tree mortality. However, neither the magnitude of expected mortality increases, nor the potential effectiveness of basal area reduction, has been quantified in dryland forests such as those of the drought‐prone Southwest US. We used thousands of repeatedly measured forest plots to show that unusually warm and dry conditions are related to high tree mortality rates and that mortality is positively related to basal area. Those relationships suggest that while increasing high temperature extremes forecasted by climate models may lead to elevated tree mortality during the 21st century, future tree mortality might be partly ameliorated by reducing stand basal area. This adaptive forest management strategy may provide a window of opportunity for forest managers and policy makers to guide forest transitions to species and/or genotypes more suited to future climates.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3astems 3aarid lands 3adry environmental conditions 3aclimate change 3aforest management 3atrees 3agenotype 3aclimate models 3atemperature 3astand basal area 3atree mortality 3amortality 3aclimate 3aforests 3aSouthwestern United States 0abasal area1 aBell, David MeauthoruPacific Northwest Research Station, US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, Corvallis, OR0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2017 Feb., v. 15, no. 1 p.11-17dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2308340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.14453Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aArticle  aJournal:23083b1540-9295c15d1e11  fFrontiers in ecology and the environment  aBatch:1933  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058978049ExL  a2018-05-11  a15409295_2017_15_1.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1933 reviewed on 2018-05-11T04:00:02Z  aagid:5897804  a2018-02-26  a2019-09-2605420nab a2200961 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098024003600137024004300173035002800216040001800244100012300262245014500385300001500530506002800545506003600573506007600609506003100685520156400716592002802280593001802308596008302326596008302409596004402492506003702536650001102573650001902584650002702603650000902630650001602639650001502655650001402670650001602684650001102700650001102711650001802722650001502740650002602755650000902781650000802790650001502798650001302813650001602826650002002842651002902862653001902891653002602910653001002936653001202946653001902958653001602977653001702993653001003010653002603020700013103046700014703177700014403324700014803468700012503616773012703741787003303868787001803901787002203919856008303941903002404024912001204048914004104060914004204101916001504143917001104158918003604169935002204205949001504227953006004242954006104302955003504363961001304398974001704411983001504428984001504443991575283630742620221207085902.0190318e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052545572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2015.11.0112chorus7 a10.1016/j.agee.2015.11.0112doi7 a10.1016/j.agee.2015.11.0112chorusOpen  aagid:5254557-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasche, Andrea D.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Agronomy Hall, Ames, IA 50011, United States10aSimulating long-term impacts of cover crops and climate change on crop production and environmental outcomes in the Midwestern United States  ap. 95-106.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aIt is critical to evaluate conservation practices that protect soil and water resources from climate change in the Midwestern United States, a region that produces one-quarter of the world’s soybeans and one-third of the world’s maize. An over-winter cover crop in a maize–soybean rotation offers multiple potential benefits that can reduce the impacts of higher temperatures and more variable rainfall; some of the anticipated changes for the Midwest. In this experiment we used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to understand how winter rye cover crops impact crop production and environmental outcomes, given future climate change. We first tested APSIM with data from a long-term maize–soybean rotation with and without winter rye cover crop field site. Our modeling work predicted that the winter rye cover crop has a neutral effect on maize and soybean yields over the 45 year simulation period but increases in minimum and maximum temperatures were associated with reduced yields of 1.6–2.7% by decade. Soil carbon decreased in both the cover crop and no cover crop simulations, although the cover crop is able to significantly offset (3% less loss over 45 years) this decline compared to the no cover crop simulation. Our predictions showed that the cover crop led to an 11–29% reduction in erosion and up to a 34% decrease in nitrous oxide emissions (N2O). However, the cover crop is unable to offset future predicted yield declines and does not increase the overall carbon balance relative to current soil conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cLeopold Center for Sustainable Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100015824  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000010 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aconservation practices 3acorn 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3aemissions 3afield crops 3afields 3amodels 3anitrous oxide 3aprediction 3aproduction technology 3arain 3arye 3asoil water 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3awater resources 3aMidwestern United States 0aClimate change 0aCereal rye cover crop 0aMaize 0aSoybean 0aGreenhouse gas 0aSoil carbon 0aSoil erosion 0aAPSIM 0aMidwest United States1 aArchontoulis, Sotirios V.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Agronomy Hall, Ames, IA 50011, United States1 aKaspar, Thomas C.eauthoruNational Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, USDA-ARS, 2150 Pammel Drive, Ames, IA 50014, United States1 aJaynes, Dan B.eauthoruNational Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, USDA-ARS, 2150 Pammel Drive, Ames, IA 50014, United States1 aParkin, Timothy B.eauthoruNational Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, USDA-ARS, 2150 Pammel Drive, Ames, IA 50014, United States1 aMiguez, Fernando E.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Agronomy Hall, Ames, IA 50011, United States0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 218 p.95-106dElsevier B.V.aZwJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl3470940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aArticle  aJournal:jnl34709b0167-8809c218e95  fAgriculture, ecosystems & environment  aBatch:1423  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6052545579ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00031-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0167880915301468.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:5254557  a2019-03-18  a2022-09-0206000nab a2200961 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004300098024004000141024004700181035002800228040001800256100013900274245008600413300001600499506007600515506003100591520222100622592002802843593001802871596006802889596010302957596006003060506003703120650001403157650001303171650002603184650001903210650001103229650001203240650002603252650000903278650001503287650001403302650002203316650001003338650001103348650001703359650001303376650001703389650002403406650001203430650002103442650001603463651001303479651001403492653000703506653003103513653001203544653001703556653001603573653002003589653001903609700020603628700008003834700008303914700008203997700017804079773011804257787003304375787001804408787001904426856008704445856004504532912001204577914003904589914002804628916001504656917001104671918003604682935002204718949001504740953006004755954006104815955003504876961001604911962004704927962001704974974001704991983001505008984001505023991575569010742620221215143608.0180904e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056405902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.01.0492chorus7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.01.0492doi7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.01.0492chorusOpen  aagid:5640590-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaynes, Kristine M.eauthoruUniversity of Toronto, Department of Geography, Department of Physical and Environmental Sciences, Canada10aGaseous mercury fluxes in peatlands and the potential influence of climate change  ap. 247-259.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aClimate change has the potential to significantly impact the stability of large stocks of mercury (Hg) stored in peatland systems due to increasing temperatures, altered water table regimes and subsequent shifts in vascular plant communities. However, the Hg exchange dynamics between the atmosphere and peatlands are not well understood. At the PEATcosm Mesocosm Facility in Houghton, Michigan, total gaseous Hg (TGM) fluxes were monitored in a subset of 1-m³ peat monoliths with altered water table positions (high and low) and vascular plant functional groups (sedge only, Ericaceae only or unmanipulated control) above the Sphagnum moss layer. At the SPRUCE bog in north-central Minnesota, TGM fluxes were measured from plots subjected to deep peat soil warming (up to +9 °C above ambient at a depth of 2 m). At PEATcosm, the strongest depositional trend was observed with the Low WT – sedge only treatment mesocosms with a mean TGM flux of −73.7 ± 6.3 ng m⁻² d⁻¹, likely due to shuttling of Hg to the peat at depth by aerenchymous tissues. The highest total leaf surface and tissue Hg concentrations were observed with the Ericaceae shrubs. A negative correlation between TGM flux and Ericaceae total leaf surface area suggests an influence of shrubs in controlling Hg exchange through stomatal uptake, surface sorption and potentially, peat shading. Surface peat total Hg concentrations are highest in treatments with greatest deposition suggesting deposition controls Hg accumulation in surface peat. Fluxes in the SPRUCE plots ranged from −45.9 ± 93.8 ng m⁻² d⁻¹ prior to the implementation of the deep warming treatments to −1.41 ± 27.1 ng m⁻² d⁻¹ once warming targets were achieved at depth and +10.2 ± 44.6 ng m⁻² d⁻¹ following prolonged deep soil warming. While these intervals did not differ significantly, a significant positive increase in the slope of the regression between flux and surface temperature was observed across the pre-treatment and warming periods. Shifts in vascular vegetation cover and peat warming as a result of climate change may significantly affect the dynamics of TGM fluxes between peatlands and the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006435  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000069590 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEricaceae 3aSphagnum 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aclimate change 3aleaves 3amercury 3amosses and liverworts 3apeat 3apeat soils 3apeatlands 3aplant communities 3ashade 3ashrubs 3asoil heating 3asorption 3asurface area 3asurface temperature 3atissues 3avegetation cover 3awater table 3aMichigan 3aMinnesota 0aHg 0aTotal gaseous mercury flux 0aWetland 0aSoil warming 0aWater table 0aPlant community 0aClimate change1 aKane, Evan S.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service Northern Research Station; Michigan Technological University, School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1665-05961 aPotvin, LynetteeauthoruUSDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, USA1 aLilleskov, Erik A.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, USA1 aKolka, Randall K.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, USA1 aMitchell, Carl P.J.eauthoruUniversity of Toronto, Department of Geography, Department of Physical and Environmental Sciences, Canada1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8538-51380 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 Apr., v. 154 p.247-259dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1203140uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.01.0493Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5640590  aArticle  aJournal:12031b1352-2310c154e247  fAtmospheric environment  aBatch:1580  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6056405909ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/22-2-00071-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S1352231017300651.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FSUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1873-2844  aMissing ISSN  aagid:5640590  a2018-09-04  a2022-09-0205249nab a2200853 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004000098024004300138035002800181040001800209100015200227245011900379300001500498506007600513506003100589520134700620592002801967593001801995596006502013506003702078650002402115650001302139650001202152650001902164650001902183650000902202650001602211650001602227650001502243650002302258650001602281650001202297650002202309650001302331650001602344650001602360651002102376651002902397653001902426653001602445653001602461653002202477700017602499700014902675700022602824700015603050700021403206700020403420773010103624787003303725787001803758787001903776856008703795856004503882912001203927914003803939914002503977916001504002917001104017918003604028935002204064949001504086953007804101954006104179955003504240961000904275962004704284962001704331974001704348983001504365984001504380991575618940742620221215142546.0190620e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060373722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.04.0152doi7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.04.0152chorus  aagid:6037372-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, WyatteauthoruAgricultural and Applied Economics Department, University of Missouri, 200 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211, United States10aAutomatic Responses of Crop Stocks and Policies Buffer Climate Change Effects on Crop Markets and Price Volatility  ap. 98-105.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aClimate change has the potential to affect crop prices and price volatility. However, the economic models used in prior assessments largely do not include known, automatic, stabilizing factors. Crop storage can stabilize prices and U.S. crop policy tends to provide support that moves opposite prices. We quantify effects of circa 2050 climate forcing on the inter-annual variability of U.S. Corn Belt corn and soybean yields using statistical crop models and climate scenarios from regional and global climate models. Climate change generally reduces mean yields and increases the inter-annual variability of yields in the Midwestern U.S. Using these yield impacts and an economic model with automatic market stabilizers, we find only modest increases in price volatility. Although individual producers and states are negatively affected by the yield reductions, the aggregate effect for all corn and soybean producer returns can be positive because of price increases. Moreover, agricultural policies based on price levels or revenue variation offset some of the impacts of market variation on farm income. Our results differ from other recent results and temper concerns that increasing climate instability necessarily translates to greater uncertainty about agricultural commodity uses, including as food and biofuels, in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cCooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural policy 3abiofuels 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acorn 3acrop models 3acrop prices 3acrop yield 3aeconometric models 3afarm income 3amarkets 3aradiative forcing 3asoybeans 3astabilizers 3auncertainty 3aCorn Belt region 3aMidwestern United States 0aClimate change 0aCrop stocks 0aCrop yields 0aPrice variability1 aLu, YaqiongeauthoruSierra Nevada Research Institute, University of California, Merced, 5200 North Lake Road, Science and Engineering 277, Merced, CA 95343, United States1 aGerlt, ScotteauthoruAgricultural and Applied Economics Department, University of Missouri, 200 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211, United States1 aYang, XianyueauthoruSierra Nevada Research Institute, University of California, Merced and Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Science, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, China1 aCampbell, J.

Climate change may also affect the mobilisation of natural metal sources, with potential ecological consequences beyond mountains' geographical limits; however, this question has remained largely unexplored. We investigated this by analysing a number of key climatic factors in relationship with trace metal accumulation in the sediment core of a Pyrenean lake. The sediment metal contents showed increasing accumulation trend over time, and their levels varied in step with recent climate change. The findings further revealed that a rise in the elevation of freezing level, a general increase in the frequency of drier periods, changes in the frequency of winter freezing days and a reducing snow cover since the early 1980s, together are responsible for the observed variability and augmented accumulation of trace metals. Our results provide clear evidence of increased mobilisation of natural metal sources - an overlooked effect of climate change on the environment. With further alterations in climate equilibrium predicted over the ensuing decades, it is likely that mountain catchments in metamorphic areas may become significant sources of trace metals, with potentially harmful consequences for the wider environment.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aenvironmental impact 3afreezing 3alakes 3ametals 3amountains 3asediments 3asnowpack 3atrace elements 3awatersheds 0aClimate change 0aHigh altitude 0aTrace elements 0aLakebed sediment record 0aWeathering and transportation 0aContaminant risk1 aHooda, Peter S.eauthoruSchool of Natural and Built Environments, Kingston University London, UK1 aBurghelea, Carmen I.eauthoruBiosphere-2, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA1 aPolyakov, ViktoreauthoruSouthwest Research Center, United States Department of Agriculture, Tucson, AZ, USA1 aPalanca-Soler, AntonioeauthoruFaculty of Biological Sciences, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 560-561 p.73-81dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl445540uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4455b0048-9697c560-561e73  fScience of the total environment  aBatch:1422  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6053155569ExL  a2016-09-06  a33533-00002-HEAD-ONLY-COLL_DEV_SELECTED_SUBJECTS.zip  aUSDA  aagid:5315556  a2017-07-13  a2017-07-1305118nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002100098024003300119024001100152035002600163040001800189100003300207245006600240300001300306506017300319520262300492593001803115593002003133650001903153650001203172650001903184650002003203650001003223650002303233650002603256650003003282650001503312650001403327650001203341650001003353650001603363650002503379650002303404650002803427650001203455773006803467787003303535787001803568787003003586787001903616856011203635856004603747912001203793914003503805914001603840917001103856935002203867949001503889956009103904961000903995962003004004962004804034962004704082962004704129962004704176974001504223983001504238984001504253985011704268986001104385991575971250742620221122110314.0130911s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006994852DNAL7 a10113/576872hdl7 a10.1079/PAVSNNR201270622doi8 ans3217  aagid:57687-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaradat, Abdullah A.eauthor10aAnticipating impacts of climate change on organic agriculture  ap. 1-22.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBoth conventional agriculture (CA) and organic agriculture (OA) are inextricably linked to climate and will impact and be impacted by climate change (CC). OA, unlike CA, encompasses heterogeneous agricultural management methods and practices, given its multiple origins around the world. Although it represents < 1% of the world’s agricultural production and about 9% of total agricultural area, OA is a globally growing, low-input, dynamic and knowledge-intensive production system. It provides a larger flow of multiple ecosystems services than, and differs fundamentally from, CA in the conceptual approaches that frame crop, animal and natural resources-management strategies. Organic farmers have fewer means to manage their production systems and they need greater expertise and more time to optimize the management of OA in the face of CC. The diverse OA-based agroecological systems (AESs), compared with CA, provide more regulatory functions that enable OA to adjust to changing environmental conditions; however, OA may experience larger inter-annual variability which is attributed to fewer short-term possibilities for controlling biotic and abiotic stresses. Nevertheless, small-scale organic farmers and communities are seemingly able to cope with weather fluctuations and climate extremes because of the self-regulating ability of OA and the enormous variability in internal adaptation strategies they have developed over time. However, vulnerability of OA to CC will eventually depend on the level of exposure and sensitivity to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses, and on its intrinsic buffering capacity for adaptation and mitigation. Long-term sustainability of OA in the face of CC is intractably linked to ecological sustainability. CC and ecological disturbances may force OA to undergo structural changes or adjustments as to land area; farm size and land tenure; farming complexity, crop–livestock integration, sustainable intensification and specialization; environmental stewardship; and labour intensity. Conventionalization, to the extent that it does not undermine its core principles, may become the only economically viable structural change option to adapt large-scale OA to CC. In order to minimize the impact of CC, OA needs to function within the broader context of multidisciplinary agro-ecological principles, while adopting scientifically based, resource-efficient and semi-closed AESs’ approach. The challenge facing OA is to develop measurable and reliable biophysical vulnerability indicators to prioritize adaptation and mitigation efforts at the farm and local levels.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aabiotic stress 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3acrops 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental stewardship 3afarm labor 3afarm size 3afarmers 3afarms 3aland tenure 3alivestock production 3aorganic production 3asustainable agriculture 3aweather0 tCAB Reviews.g2012, v. 7 p.1-22wJournal:26723x1749-88487nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)2672340uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/576873Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PAVSNNR20127062  aArticle  aJournal:26723b1749-8848c7e1  fCAB Reviews  aissued  aIND5006994859ExL  a2013-11-08  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/115749_1615.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:375 annotated on 2013-10-28T11:14:55Z  aBatch:375 reviewed on 2013-11-08T12:00:04Z  aBatch:375 reviewed on 2013-11-08T15:00:05Z  aBatch:375 reviewed on 2013-11-08T17:00:04Z  aagid:57687  a2013-09-11  a2013-10-18  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.XXX 2012/012/28)  ans321706163nab a2200949 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002300115024003900138024002500177024004100202024002300243035002800266040001800294100017000312245014900482506010400631506007600735520200800811592002802819593001802847506003702865593002002902650001302922650002002935650003002955650001902985650001903004650002103023650001103044650002403055650003003079650001303109650002103122650001903143651001103162651000903173651001403182651001103196651002503207651001603232651001803248651001803266653003803284653001903322653001703341653004003358653001803398700013103416700009203547700016603639700017003805700017303975700017304148773010104321787003304422787001804455787001804473856008604491856011404577912001204691914004104703914002604744916001604770917001104786918003604797935002204833949001504855952001504870953009104885954006104976955003505037961001305072962003005085962003105115962002005146974001705166983001505183984001505198991576016930742620221214231449.0220921e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075129922DNAL7 a3820002aris7 a10113/75129922hdl7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082042doi7 a4359772aris_accn_no7 a2080-21000-018-000D2aris_project_no7 a3820002seq_no_115  aagid:7512992-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, JingeauthoruDepartment of Grassland Resources and Ecosystem, College of Grassland Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China10aPotential impact of climate change on the global geographical distribution of the invasive species, Cenchrus spinifex (Field sandbur, Gramineae)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aField sandbur (Cenchrus spinifex Cav.) is an annual grass native to North America that has spread widely in South America, Europe, Asia, Australia and other regions, reducing crop and grassland productivity. In recent decades, global climate change and human activity have been linked to the spread of C. spinifex and its impact on ecosystem and biodiversity. In order to characterize the role of climate change on this trend and highlight regions of high invasion risk, we used global distribution data and maximum entropy models (MaxEnt) to analyze suitable habitats based on four global climate models and two representative concentration pathways under different climate scenarios. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis method was also used to further verify the prediction accuracy of the model, which was statistically significant (AUC = 0.921). Climatically suitable areas of C. spinifex at present climate conditions were located at six continents including central South America, southern parts of North America and Africa, most of Mediterranean coastal European regions, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Future climate conditions may promote C. spinifex expansion into coastal regions. Meanwhile, C. spinifex in the northern hemisphere were expected to spread further southward (20-55°N; 30-55°S) compared to present potential geographical distribution. The suitable habitat area of C. spinifex would be slightly reduced in 2050 and 2070. Seasonal precipitation, precipitation of driest quarter (bio15, bio17) and mean temperature of warmest and coldest quarter (bio10, bio11) could be the major environmental variables affecting the potential distribution of C. spinifex. Preventing the spread of C. spinifex in the future will require strict phytosanitary measures to reduce colonization of new regions, such as Japan, India, Russia, and Thailand. Our research provides a foundation to focus future management efforts and prioritize area of greatest ecological concern.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article0 fUnrestricted online access2star  eARIS manuscript 3aCenchrus 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3acoasts 3aecological invasion 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3aphytogeography 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aAustralia 3aEurope 3aMediterranean region 3aNew Zealand 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 0aField sandbur (Cenchrus spinifex) 0aInvasive plant 0aMaxEnt model 0aPotential geographical distribution 0aRisk analysis1 aXu, JuneauthoruCollege of Grassland, Resources and Environment, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Hohhot 010011, China1 aPan, XubineauthoruChinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, Beijing 100176, China1 aMonaco, Thomas A.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Forage and Range Research Laboratory, Utah State University, Logan, UT 84322-6300, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1472-73261 aZhao, KuneauthoruDepartment of Grassland Resources and Ecosystem, College of Grassland Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China1 aWang, DepingeauthoruDepartment of Grassland Resources and Ecosystem, College of Grassland Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China1 aRong, YupingeauthoruDepartment of Grassland Resources and Ecosystem, College of Grassland Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Nov., v. 131 p.108204-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)619640uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082043Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/75129923Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:6196b1470-160Xc131e108204  fEcological indicators  aBatch:10194  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6075129929ExL  a2022-06-04  dgolden set  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/151469736909111354-00004-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S1470160X21008694.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aARIS manuscript submission  aARIS Manuscript  aagid:7512992  a2022-09-21  a2022-09-2104542nab a2200817 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002100098024003900119024001100158035002600169040001800195100003100213245013900244300001600383506017300399520167500572593001802247593002002265650001402285650001402299650002002313650001502333650001302348650003002361650002602391650001202417650001902429650001202448650001902460650002402479650003102503650001502534650001902549650001302568650001902581650002602600650001202626650002402638651001402662651001402676651001802690651001702708700003302725700003002758773007902788787003302867787001802900787003002918787002102948856011202969856005203081912001203133914004103145914002503186917001103211935002203222949001503244956011103259961000903370962003003379962004803409962004703457962004703504974001503551983001503566984001503581985011703596986001103713991576081230742620221120173354.0130904s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006932232DNAL7 a10113/576152hdl7 a10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00415-52doi8 ans3037  aagid:57615-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinslow, Jerome C.eauthor14aThe influence of seasonal water availability on global C3 versus C4 grassland biomass and its implications for climate change research  ap. 153-173.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aClimate-change induced alterations in the global distribution of cool season (C(3)) and warm season (C(4)) grasses would impact the global carbon cycle and have differing, local effects on range and agricultural production. We hypothesize that a major influence on C(3)/C(4) distribution may be the seasonal timing of water availability with respect to the different C(3) and C(4) growing seasons. An algorithm expressing this hypothesis (the SAW hypothesis for Seasonal Availability of Water), estimates C(3) versus C(4) grass biomass from climate data. Sensitivity analysis indicated that temperatures used to delineate the start and end of the C(3) and C(4)grass growing seasons were more important than photosynthetic responses to temperature. To evaluate the SAW hypothesis, this algorithm was applied globally on a 1°×1° latitude–longitude grid. When compared with vegetation survey data at 141 locations in North America, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa, SAW algorithm predictions yielded an R(2) of 0.71. Error resulted primarily from comparing large grid cells to plot data, interannual variability of climate, and from gridding measured climate to data-sparse locations with a single lapse rate of air temperature with elevation. Application of the SAW algorithm to a climate change scenario suggested that changes in temperature and precipitation patterns could offset C(3) photosynthetic advantages offered by elevated atmospheric CO(2) concentrations. These results underscored the importance of accurately representing the timing and spatial distribution as well as the magnitude of temperature and precipitation in scenarios of future climate.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3aair temperature 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acool season grasses 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3agrasslands 3agrowing season 3alatitude 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant available water 3asurveys 3awarm season grasses 3aArgentina 3aAustralia 3aNorth America 3aSouth Africa1 aHunt Jr., E.

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a native perennial herbaceous grass, is a promising candidate for cellulosic feedstock production. In this study, current and future (from 2080 to 2090) productivity is estimated across the central and eastern United States using ALMANAC, a mechanistic model that simulates plant growth over time. The ALMANAC model was parameterized for representative ecotypes of switchgrass. Our results indicate substantial variation in switchgrass productivity both within regions and over time. States along the Gulf Coast, southern Atlantic Coast, and in the East North Central Midwest have the highest current biomass potential. However, these areas also contain critical wetland habitat necessary for the maintenance of biodiversity and agricultural lands necessary for food production. The southern United States is predicted to have the largest decrease in future biomass production. The Great Plains are expected to experience large increases in productivity by 2080–2090 due to climate change. In general, regions where future temperature and precipitation are predicted to increase are also where larger future biomass production is expected. In contrast, regions that show a future decrease in precipitation are associated with smaller future biomass production. Switchgrass appears to be a promising biofuel crop for the central and eastern United States, with local biomass predicted to be high (>10 Mg/ha) for ∼50% of the area studied for each climate scenario. In order to minimize land conversion and loss of biodiversity, areas that currently have and maintain high productivity under climate change should be targeted for their long‐term growth potential.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aPanicum virgatum 3aagricultural land 3aannuals 3abiodiversity 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3aecotypes 3aenergy crops 3afeedstocks 3afood production 3afuel production 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aland use change 3amechanistic models 3aperennials 3atemperature 3awetlands 3aGreat Plains region 3aSoutheastern United States1 aKiniry, James R.eauthoruGrassland, Soil, and Water Research Laboratory, USDA-ARS, 808 East Blackland Road, Temple, Texas 76502 USA1 aWinchell, MichaeleauthoruStone Environmental Incorporated, 535 Stone Cutters Way, Montpelier, Vermont 05602 USA1 aJuenger, Thomas E.eauthoruSection of Integrative Biology, University of Texas, 1 University Station C0930, Austin, Texas 78712 USA1 aKeitt, Timothy H.eauthoruSection of Integrative Biology, University of Texas, 1 University Station C0930, Austin, Texas 78712 USA0 tEcological applications.g2013 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.73-85dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4719340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-0436.13Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl47193b1051-0761c23d1e73  fEcological applications  aBatch:1910  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058762269ExL  a2018-02-28  a10510761_2013_23_1.xml  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:1910 reviewed on 2018-02-28T15:00:02Z  aagid:5876226  a2018-01-02  a2018-02-2805074nab a2200649 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100027600180245015800456300001600614520157100630592002802201593001802229596003002247596003002277596003002307596002902337596007702366596007702443596007702520650002102597650001902618650002302637650003002660650001202690651001402702651001002716700011902726700024202845700024003087700016503327700022603492773014303718787003303861787001803894787002403912856008303936912001204019914004604031914003504077917001104112918002904123935002204152949001504174952001904189953006704208954005604275955003704331961000904368974001704377983001504394984001504409991576438000742620221120163905.0220411e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077294242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-022-00384-52doi  aagid:7729424-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, Carolina L.eauthoruGrupo de Ecología de la Polinización (EcoPol), INIBIOMA (CONICET, Universidad Nacional del Comahue), Quintral 1250, 8400, San Carlos de Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina. moralesc@comahue-conicet.gob.ar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9989-534710aDoes climate change influence the current and future projected distribution of an endangered species? The case of the southernmost bumblebee in the world  ap. 257-269.  aINTRODUCTION: Cold-adapted bumblebees are vulnerable to climate change (CC). South American Bombus dahlbomii, the southernmost bumblebee worldwide, has strongly declined since the 1990s and may be particularly susceptible to current and future CC. AIMS/METHODS: We asked (1) whether current CC had a role in the observed decline of this species and (2) how projected CC would affect the future distribution of B. dahlbomii. We used a comprehensive record of occurrences for B. dahlbomii and species distribution models (SDMs) to build maps of (1) predicted current climatic suitability using pre-1990s and post-1990s occurrences, and (2) projected current and future climatic suitability under future (2080–2100) RCP 8.5 scenarios predicted by the 5th IPCC Report. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: SDMs did not show changes in species climatic suitability pre-1990 vs. post-1990, suggesting no significant role of CC on the observed decline of the species at this time scale. However, a moderate range reduction of 13% and 14% of the ~ 0.041º grid cells was predicted by 2080–2100 under the 70% and 100% consensus models, respectively. IMPLICATIONS FOR INSECT CONSERVATION: Identifying the threats to B. dahlbomii allows for prioritizing conservation efforts. Short-term threats imposed by invasive bumblebees deserve urgent attention. The potential synergies between this threat and CC need to be understood to better predict the fate of this species. Binational cooperation should guarantee connectivity between climatically suitable areas in Argentina and Chile.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aNE/S011870/1cNewton Fund  aNE/S011870/1cNewton Fund  aNE/S011870/1cNewton Fund  a304494/2019-4cCNpq-Proc  aRD 1984/19cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas  aRD 1984/19cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas  aRD 1984/19cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas 3aBombus dahlbomii 3aclimate change 3aendangered species 3ageographical distribution 3ainsects 3aArgentina 3aChile1 aMontalva, JoseeauthoruDepartment of Biological and Environmental Sciences, East Central University, Ada, OK, USA1 aArbetman, Marina P.eauthoruGrupo de Ecología de la Polinización (EcoPol), INIBIOMA (CONICET, Universidad Nacional del Comahue), Quintral 1250, 8400, San Carlos de Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8382-25221 aAizen, Marcelo A.eauthoruGrupo de Ecología de la Polinización (EcoPol), INIBIOMA (CONICET, Universidad Nacional del Comahue), Quintral 1250, 8400, San Carlos de Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9079-97491 aMartins, Aline C.eauthoruDepartamento de Zoologia, Universidade de Brasilia, Campus Darcy Ribeiro, Brasilia, DF, Brazil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2305-28771 aSilva, Daniel PaivaeauthoruDepartamento de Ciências Biológicas, Instituto Federal Goiano, Rodovia Geraldo Silva Nascimento, KM 2,5, Zona Rural, Urutaí, GO, CEP 75790-000, Brazil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2457-62450 tJournal of insect conservation.g2022 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.257-269dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870062x1366-638X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl387006240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-022-00384-53Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3870062b1366-638Xc26d2e257  fJournal of insect conservation  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6077294249ExL  a2022-04-11  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_22-04-07_05-34-19.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10841-26-2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA  aagid:7729424  a2022-04-11  a2022-04-1106134nab a2201045 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002100115024003900136024001200175035002600187040001800213100003400231245011400265300001400379506017300393520256900566593001803135593002003153594002203173595004803195593002003243650001603263650004103279650001303320650001103333650001903344650001903363650001903382650002103401650002403422650000903446650001603455650001503471650001303486650002503499650002003524650001503544650001303559650001503572650003003587650001503617650001503632650001903647650001103666650001303677650001203690650001803702650002003720650001803740650001503758651002103773651002603794651001903820651002903839700003103868700003103899700003203930700003003962700002803992700002604020700003104046700003304077700003004110700003104140773013404171787003304305787001804338787001904356856011204375856008504487912001204572914002804584914006904612916001504681917001104696935002204707949001504729956008404744961000904828962003004837962004804867974001504915983001504930984001504945985011604960986001205076991576541300742620221214225839.0160721e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000628922DNAL7 a3157392aris7 a10113/628922hdl7 a10.3965/j.ijabe.20150803.14972doi8 ans10715  aagid:62892-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanagopoulos, Yianniseauthor10aImpacts of climate change on hydrology, water quality and crop productivity in the Ohio-Tennessee River Basin  ap. 36-53.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aNonpoint source pollution from agriculture is the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus in the stream systems of the Corn Belt region in the Midwestern U.S. The eastern part of this region is comprised of the Ohio-Tennessee River Basin (OTRB), which is considered a key contributing area for water pollution and the Northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone. A point of crucial importance in this basin is therefore how intensive corn-based cropping systems for food and fuel production can be sustainable and coexist with a healthy water environment, not only under existing climate but also under climate change conditions in the future. To address this issue, a OTRB integrated modeling system has been built with a greatly refined 12-digit subbasin structure based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model, which is capable of estimating landscape and in-stream water and pollutant yields in response to a wide array of alternative cropping and/or management strategies and climatic conditions. The effects of three agricultural management scenarios on crop production and pollutant loads exported from the crop land of the OTRB to streams and rivers were evaluated: (1) expansion of continuous corn across the entire basin, (2) adoption of no-till on all corn and soybean fields in the region, (3) implementation of a winter cover crop within the baseline rotations. The effects of each management scenario were evaluated both for current climate and projected mid-century (2046-2065) climates from seven global circulation models (GCMs). In both present and future climates each management scenario resulted in reduced erosion and nutrient loadings to surface water bodies compared to the baseline agricultural management, with cover crops causing the highest water pollution reduction. Corn and soybean yields in the region were negligibly influenced from the agricultural management scenarios. On the other hand, both water quality and crop yield numbers under climate change deviated considerably for all seven GCMs compared to the baseline climate. Future climates from all GCMs led to decreased corn and soybean yields by up to 20% on a mean annual basis, while water quality alterations were either positive or negative depending on the GCM. The study highlights the loss of productivity in the eastern Corn Belt under climate change, the need to consider a range of GCMs when assessing impacts of climate change, and the value of SWAT as a tool to analyze the effects of climate change on parameters of interest at the basin scale.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article  bcmartinezc2016-08-08djgilberte2016-08-08  eARIS manuscript 3aGlycine max 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aZea mays 3abasins 3abioengineering 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3acontinuous cropping 3acorn 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3acropland 3aenvironmental health 3afuel production 3alandscapes 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3anonpoint source pollution 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3apollution load 3arivers 3asoybeans 3astreams 3asurface water 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aCorn Belt region 3aEastern United States 3aGulf of Mexico 3aMidwestern United States1 aGassman, Philip W.eauthor1 aArritt, Raymond W.eauthor1 aHerzmann, Daryle E.eauthor1 aCampbell, Todd D.eauthor1 aValcu, Adriananeauthor1 aJha, Manoj K.eauthor1 aKing, Catherine L.eauthor1 aSrinivasan, Raghavaneauthor1 aWhite, Michael J.eauthor1 aArnold, Jeffrey G.eauthor0 tInternational journal of agricultural and biological engineering.g2015 June, v. 8, no. 3 p.36-53wJournal:22636x1934-63447nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2263640uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/628923Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3965/j.ijabe.20150803.14973Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:22636c8d3e36  fInternational journal of agricultural and biological engineering  aBatch:1400  aissued  aIND6000628929ExL  a2021-06-22  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/315739.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:1400 reviewed on 2016-09-07T13:00:02Z  aagid:62892  a2016-07-21  a2020-10-06  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans1071505046nab a2200769 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003300121024003600154035002800190040001800218100017700236245008600413506007600499506003100575506002800606506007200634520191100706592002802617593001802645596000902663596000902672506003702681650002302718650002402741650001702765650001102782650001202793650001902805650002302824650001202847650001502859650001402874650003002888650001602918650002302934650002102957651002302978700008603001700011603087700009303203700011003296773011903406787003303525787001803558787002203576856011403598856008003712912001203792914003703804914005203841916001603893917001103909918002703920935002203947949001503969955003403984961000904018962003004027962004704057974001704104979003404121984001504155985010604170991577137810742620221215143615.0220901e20170418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073446292DNAL7 a10113/73446292hdl7 a10.1073/pnas.16096331142doi7 a10.1073/pnas.16096331142chorus  aagid:7344629-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerow, CoryeauthoruEcology and Evolutionary Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06511;, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269;10aClimate change both facilitates and inhibits invasive plant ranges in New England  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aResource is Open Access  aProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences License Information  aForecasting ecological responses to climate change, invasion, and their interaction must rely on understanding underlying mechanisms. However, such forecasts require extrapolation into new locations and environments. We linked demography and environment using experimental biogeography to forecast invasive and native species’ potential ranges under present and future climate in New England, United States to overcome issues of extrapolation in novel environments. We studied two potentially nonequilibrium invasive plants’ distributions, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry), each paired with their native ecological analogs to better understand demographic drivers of invasions. Our models predict that climate change will considerably reduce establishment of a currently prolific invader (A. petiolata) throughout New England driven by poor demographic performance in warmer climates. In contrast, invasion of B. thunbergii will be facilitated because of higher growth and germination in warmer climates, with higher likelihood to establish farther north and in closed canopy habitats in the south. Invasion success is in high fecundity for both invasive species and demographic compensation for A. petiolata relative to native analogs. For A. petiolata, simulations suggest that eradication efforts would require unrealistic efficiency; hence, management should focus on inhibiting spread into colder, currently unoccupied areas, understanding source–sink dynamics, and understanding community dynamics should A. petiolata (which is allelopathic) decline. Our results—based on considerable differences with correlative occurrence models typically used for such biogeographic forecasts—suggest the urgency of incorporating mechanism into range forecasting and invasion management to understand how climate change may alter current invasion patterns.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlliaria petiolata 3aBerberis thunbergii 3abiogeography 3acanopy 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acolonizing ability 3adecline 3ademography 3afecundity 3ageographical distribution 3agermination 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aNew England region1 aBois, Sarah TreanoreauthoruLinda Loring Nature Foundation, Nantucket, MA 02554;1 aAllen, Jenica M.eauthoruNatural Resources and the Environment, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824;1 aXie, YingyingeauthoruDepartment of Geography, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 142611 aSilander, John A.eauthoruEcology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269;0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.dProceedings of the National Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4568040uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73446293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.16096331143Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl45680c114d16eE3276  fProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  aBatch:10133  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073446299ExL  a2022-02-22  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1091-6490  aagid:7344629  aArticle missing volume number  a2022-09-06  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl05698nab a2201153 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001900098024001700117024002100134024002700155024001100182035002600193040001800219100002600237245008800263300001800351506017300369520169100542593001802233593002002251594002202271593002002293650001302313650002002326650001902346650001902365650002102384650000902405650001602414650001602430650002202446650001602468651001102484651001102495651000902506651001302515700002802528700003102556700002702587700002402614700002802638700003202666700002702698700002502725700002902750700002502779700003202804700003002836700002602866700002702892700002902919700003202948700003002980700003103010700002803041700002503069700003003094700003203124700003103156700003603187700002703223700002903250700002803279700003103307700002603338700002903364700003503393700002603428700002903454700002203483700002803505700002703533700002803560773010003588787003303688787001803721787002203739856011203761856004003873912001203913914004503925914002603970917001103996935002204007949001504029956014704044961000904191962003004200962004804230962004704278962004704325974001504372983001504387984001504402985011604417986001104533991577246120742620221214225319.0140617e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009026662DNAL7 a243955892pmid7 a2952522aris7 a10113/589322hdl7 a10.1111/gcb.125202doi8 ans4695  aagid:58932-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassu, Simonaeauthor10aHow do various maize crop models vary in their responses to climate change factors?  ap. 2301-2320.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aPotential consequences of climate change on crop production can be studied using mechanistic crop simulation models. While a broad variety of maize simulation models exist, it is not known whether different models diverge on grain yield responses to changes in climatic factors, or whether they agree in their general trends related to phenology, growth, and yield. With the goal of analyzing the sensitivity of simulated yields to changes in temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations [CO2], we present the largest maize crop model intercomparison to date, including 23 different models. These models were evaluated for four locations representing a wide range of maize production conditions in the world: Lusignan (France), Ames (USA), Rio Verde (Brazil) and Morogoro (Tanzania). While individual models differed considerably in absolute yield simulation at the four sites, an ensemble of a minimum number of models was able to simulate absolute yields accurately at the four sites even with low data for calibration, thus suggesting that using an ensemble of models has merit. Temperature increase had strong negative influence on modeled yield response of roughly -0.5 Mg ha-1 per °C. Doubling [CO2] from 360 to 720 µmol mol-1 increased grain yield by 7.5% on average across models and the sites. That would therefore make temperature the main factor altering maize yields at the end of this century. Furthermore, there was a large uncertainty in the yield response to [CO2] among models. Model responses to temperature and [CO2] did not differ whether models were simulated with low calibration information or, simulated with high level of calibration information.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article  eARIS manuscript 3aZea mays 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acorn 3acrop models 3agrain yield 3asimulation models 3auncertainty 3aBrazil 3aFrance 3aIowa 3aTanzania1 aBrisson, Nadineeauthor1 aDurand, Jean-Louiseauthor1 aBoote, Kennetheauthor1 aLizaso, Joneauthor1 aJones, James W.eauthor1 aRosenzweig, Cynthiaeauthor1 aRuane, Alex C.eauthor1 aAdam, Myriameauthor1 aBaron, Christianeauthor1 aBasso, Brunoeauthor1 aBiernath, Christianeauthor1 aBoogaard, Hendrikeauthor1 aConijn, Sjaakeauthor1 aCorbeels, Marceauthor1 aDeryng, Delphineeauthor1 aDe Sanctis, Giacomoeauthor1 aGayler, Sebastianeauthor1 aGrassini, Patricioeauthor1 aHatfield, Jerryeauthor1 aHoek, Steveneauthor1 aIzaurralde, Cesareauthor1 aJongschaap, Raymondeauthor1 aKemanian, Armen R.eauthor1 aKersebaum, K.

Moreover summer temperatures are predicted to increase and precipitation is expected to decrease in most areas of the U.S. Great Basin, but little is known of the response of Mormon crickets to changes in temperature and soil moisture. In a laboratory study, we varied ambient temperature and lighting and measured the propensity of mating pairs to mate, and the proportion of eggs that developed into embryos. We found that reproduction was optimal when ambient temperature reached 30°C and the insects were beneath broad-spectrum lights such that maternal body and soil temperatures reached 35°C. Fewer eggs that developed fully were laid when maternal body and soil temperatures reached 30°C or 37–39°C. We also varied initial soil moisture from 0% to 100% saturated and found that more eggs reached embryonic diapause when initial soil moisture was 25% or 50% of saturated volume. However more of the developed eggs hatched when treated in summer soils with 0–25% of saturated moisture. We conclude that small changes in temperature had large effects on reproduction, whereas large changes in moisture had very small effects on reproduction. This is the first report of Mormon crickets mating in a laboratory setting and laying eggs that hatched, facilitating further research on the role of maternal and embryonic environments in changes in population size.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aAnabrus simplex 3aambient temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adiapause 3aeggs 3apopulation size 3areproduction 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asummer 0aDrought 0aGlobal warming 0aKatydid 0aMaternal effect 0aPlasticity 0aRearing0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2014 June, v. 65 p.57-62dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl4577240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.05.0053Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/589003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl45772b00221910c65e57  fJournal of insect physiology  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND5009009559ExL  a2019-03-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00011-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0022191014000808.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Srygley_302769.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:580 annotated on 2014-06-13T07:21:08Z  aBatch:580 reviewed on 2014-07-22T10:52:02Z  aagid:58900  a2019-03-18  a2019-03-18  ans466404987nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100013200171245011200303300001800415500001900433500002000452520208100472592002802553593001802581596003802599650001602637650001902653650000902672650002002681650001202701650001202713650001902725650001302744650001402757650001202771650001002783650001302793650001502806650001902821651002902840700013302869700013603002700006803138700011003206700013203316700015403448773012403602787003303726787001803759787002203777856007303799912001203872914004603884914002603930916001603956917001103972918004303983935002204026949001504048953005804063954006204121955003404183961001304217974001704230983001504247984001504262991577297470742620221121082415.0210524e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073834512DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.155652doi  aagid:7383451-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbendroth, Lori J.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0176-781510aLengthening of maize maturity time is not a widespread climate change adaptation strategy in the US Midwest  ap. 2426-2440.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIncreasing temperatures in the US Midwest are projected to reduce maize yields because warmer temperatures hasten reproductive development and, as a result, shorten the grain fill period. However, there is widespread expectation that farmers will mitigate projected yield losses by planting longer season hybrids that lengthen the grain fill period. Here, we ask: (a) how current hybrid maturity length relates to thermal availability of the local climate, and (b) if farmers are shifting to longer season hybrids in response to a warming climate. To address these questions, we used county‐level Pioneer brand hybrid sales (Corteva Agriscience) across 17 years and 650 counties in 10 Midwest states (IA, IL, IN, MI, MN, MO, ND, OH, SD, and WI). Northern counties were shown to select hybrid maturities with growing degree day (GDD°C) requirements more closely related to the environmentally available GDD compared to central and southern counties. This measure, termed “thermal overlap,” ranged from complete 106% in northern counties to a mere 63% in southern counties. The relationship between thermal overlap and latitude was fit using split‐line regression and a breakpoint of 42.8°N was identified. Over the 17‐years, hybrid maturities shortened across the majority of the Midwest with only a minority of counties lengthening in select northern and southern areas. The annual change in maturity ranged from −5.4 to 4.1 GDD year⁻¹ with a median of −0.9 GDD year⁻¹. The shortening of hybrid maturity contrasts with widespread expectations of hybrid maturity aligning with magnitude of warming. Factors other than thermal availability appear to more strongly impact farmer decision‐making such as the benefit of shorter maturity hybrids on grain drying costs, direct delivery to ethanol biorefineries, field operability, labor constraints, and crop genetics availability. Prediction of hybrid choice under future climate scenarios must include climatic factors, physiological‐genetic attributes, socio‐economic, and operational constraints.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a2011‐68002‐30190cUSDA‐NIFA 3abiorefining 3aclimate change 3acorn 3adecision making 3aethanol 3afarmers 3afilling period 3agenetics 3aheat sums 3ahybrids 3alabor 3alatitude 3aprediction 3asocioeconomics 3aMidwestern United States1 aMiguez, Fernando E.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4627-83291 aCastellano, Michael J.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1411-79311 aCarter, Paul R.eauthoruCorteva Agriscience, Johnston, IA, USA1 aMessina, Carlos D.eauthoruCorteva Agriscience, Johnston, IA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5501-92811 aDixon, Philip M.eauthoruDepartment of Statistics, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1778-06861 aHatfield, Jerry L.eauthoruUSDA‐ARS, National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, Ames, IA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2981-88560 tGlobal change biology.g2021 June, v. 27, no. 11 p.2426-2440dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.155653Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c27d11e2426  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:10149  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6073834519ExL  a2021-06-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13541013_2021_27_11.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13541013_2021_27_11.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:7383451  a2021-05-24  a2021-06-1805264nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024001700121024003400138024002500172024004000197024002300237035002800260040001800288100023000306245007600536520176700612593001802379593002002397650001202417650001902429650001502448650001002463650001202473650002002485650001802505650001902523650001302542650001702555650001002572700015502582700020202737700027902939700013303218700016203351700014203513700022103655700014803876700013904024773008704163787003304250787001804283787001904301856008404320912001204404914003604416914002704452917001104479935002204490949001504512952001904527961000904546974001704555983001504572984001504587991577411990742620221214223513.0220321e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077093672DNAL7 a10113/77093672hdl7 a3736572aris7 a10.1088/1748-9326/abe14b2doi7 a4365752aris_accn_no7 a3012-21610-003-00D2aris_project_no7 a3736572seq_no_115  aagid:7709367-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVila, MontserrateauthoruEstación Biológica de Doñana (EBD-CSIC), Av.

While the individual effects of environmental change and of weeds on crop yield have been assessed, the combined effects have not been broadly characterized. To explore the simultaneous impacts of weeds with changes in climate-related environmental conditions on future food production, we conducted a meta-analysis of 171 observations measuring the individual and combined effects of weeds and elevated CO(2), drought or warming on 23 crop species. The combined effect of weeds and environmental change tended to be additive. On average, weeds reduced crop yield by 28%, a value that was not significantly different from the simultaneous effect of weeds and environmental change (27%), due to increased variability when acting together. The negative effect of weeds on crop yield was mitigated by elevated CO(2) and warming, but added to the negative effect of drought. The impact of weeds with environmental change was also dependent on the photosynthetic pathway of the weed/crop pair and on crop identity. Native and non-native weeds had similarly negative effects on yield, with or without environmental change. Weed impact with environmental change was also independent of whether the crop was infested with a single or multiple weed species. Since weed impacts remain negative under environmental change, our results highlight the need to evaluate the efficacy of different weed management practices under climate change. Understanding that the effects of environmental change and weeds are, on average, additive brings us closer to developing useful forecasts of future crop performance.  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3acrops 3adrought 3afood production 3ameta-analysis 3aphotosynthesis 3aresearch 3aweed control 3aweeds1 aBeaury, EvelyneauthoruOrganismic and Evolutionary Biology Graduate Program, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, United States of America1 aBlumenthal, Dana M.eauthoruRangeland Resources & Systems Research Unit, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Fort Collins, CO 80526, United States of America1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7496-07661 aBradley, Bethany A.eauthoruOrganismic and Evolutionary Biology Graduate Program, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, United States of America and Department of Environmental Conservation, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, United States of America1 aEarly, ReganeauthoruCentre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR109 9FE, United Kingdom1 aLaginhas, Brittany E.eauthoruOrganismic and Evolutionary Biology Graduate Program, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, United States of America1 aTrillo, AlejandroeauthoruEstación Biológica de Doñana (EBD-CSIC), Av.

Negative density‐dependent feedbacks, mediated by natural enemies, are key to maintaining the high diversity of tree species found in the tropics, yet we have little understanding of how projected changes in climate are likely to affect these critical controls. Over 3 years, we evaluated the effects of a natural drought and in situ experimental warming on density‐dependent feedbacks on seedling demography in a wet tropical forest in Puerto Rico. In the +4°C warming treatment, we found that seedling survival increased with increasing density of the same species (conspecific). These positive density‐dependent feedbacks were not associated with a decrease in aboveground natural enemy pressure. If positive density‐dependent feedbacks are not transient, the diversity of tropical wet forests, which may rely on negative density dependence to drive diversity, could decline in a future warmer, drier world.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDOEdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000015  cUSGSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000203  aDE‐SC‐0011806cUS Department of Energy  a89243018S‐SC‐000014cUS Department of Energy  aDE‐SC‐0018942cUS Department of Energy  cUS Geological Survey  cUSDA  cUniversity of Puerto Rico‐Río Piedras0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNeotropics 3aclimate change 3aconspecificity 3ademography 3adrought 3anatural enemies 3aseedlings 3atrees 3atropical rain forests 3aPuerto Rico1 aAlonso‐Rodríguez, Aura M.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry, Jardín Botánico Sur, Río Piedras, Puerto Rico1 aAldrich‐Wolfe, LauraeauthoruDepartment of Biological Sciences, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA1 aCavaleri, Molly A.eauthoruSchool of Forest Resources and Environmental Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA1 aReed, Sasha C.eauthoruSouthwest Biological Science Center, US Geological Survey, Moab, UT, USA1 aWood, Tana E.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry, Jardín Botánico Sur, Río Piedras, Puerto Rico1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6322-62240 tGlobal change biology.g2020 June, v. 26, no. 6 p.3417-3428dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.150873Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c26d6e3417  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:10149  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6069615519ExL  a2021-06-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13541013_2020_26_6.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13541013_2020_26_6.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6961551  a2020-05-22  a2021-06-1805808nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098024003800133024002200171024001900193035002800212040001800240100020600258245015100464300001000615500001100625506007600636520216800712592002802880593001802908596004402926506003702970650005803007650002903065650001703094650001903111650001303130650001503143650002903158650002203187650001303209650001303222651001103235651001103246651001803257700012003275700013403395700010303529700010503632700011603737700014303853700019103996700018304187773013304370787003304503787001804536787001904554856008104573912001204654914003904666914003404705916001504739917001104754918002904765935002204794949001504816953006704831954005604898955003704954961001204991974001705003983001505020984001505035991578319090742620221207050950.0181228e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059521962DNAL7 a10.1186/s13021-018-0095-32doi7 a10.1186/s13021-018-0095-32chorus7 aPMC59749922pmcid7 a298453842pmid  aagid:5952196-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgle, Stephen M.eauthoruNatural Resource Ecology Laboratory and Department of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80523, USA.

However, it is challenging to discriminate between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic sources and sinks from land. To address this problem, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change developed a managed land proxy to determine which lands are contributing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Governments report all emissions and removals from managed land to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change based on this proxy, and policy interventions to reduce emissions from land use are expected to focus on managed lands. Our objective was to review the use of the managed land proxy, and summarize the criteria that governments have applied to classify land as managed and unmanaged. We found that the large majority of governments are not reporting on their application of the managed land proxy. Among the governments that do provide information, most have assigned all area in specific land uses as managed, while designating all remaining lands as unmanaged. This designation as managed land is intuitive for croplands and settlements, which would not exist without management interventions, but a portion of forest land, grassland, and wetlands may not be managed in a country. Consequently, Brazil, Canada and the United States have taken the concept further and delineated managed and unmanaged forest land, grassland and wetlands, using additional criteria such as functional use of the land and accessibility of the land to anthropogenic activity. The managed land proxy is imperfect because reported emissions from any area can include non-anthropogenic sources, such as natural disturbances. However, the managed land proxy does make reporting of GHG emissions and removals from land use more tractable and comparable by excluding fluxes from areas that are not directly influenced by anthropogenic activity. Moreover, application of the managed land proxy can be improved by incorporating additional criteria that allow for further discrimination between managed and unmanaged land.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a13-CR-11242305-098cU.S. Forest Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3acropland 3agrasslands 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3awetlands 3aBrazil 3aCanada 3aUnited States1 aDomke, GranteauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, 1992 Folwell Avenue, St. Paul, MN, 55108, USA1 aKurz, Werner A.eauthoruNatural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service, 506 West Burnside Road, Victoria, BC, V8Z 1M5, Canada1 aRocha, Marcelo T.eauthoruFábrica Éthica Brasil, Av.

Therefore, understanding and anticipating the fate and transport of FCB are important for reducing the risk of contracting diseases. The objective of this study was to analyze the impacts of climate change on the fate and transport of FCB. We modified both the soil and the in-stream bacteria modules in the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model and verified the prediction accuracy of seasonal variability of FCB loads using observations. Forty bias-correcting GCM-RCM projections were applied in the modified SWAT model to examine various future climate conditions at the end of this century (2076–2100). Lastly, we also compared the variability of FCB loads under current and future weather conditions using multi-model ensemble simulations (MMES). The modified SWAT model yielded a satisfactory performance with regard to the seasonal variability of FCB amounts in the soil and FCB loading to water bodies. The modified SWAT model presented substantial proliferation of FCB in the soil (30.1%–147.5%) due to an increase in temperature (25.1%). Also, increase in precipitation (53.3%) led to an increase in FCB loads (96.0%–115.5%) from the soil to water body. In the in-stream environment, resuspension from the stream bed was the dominant process affecting the amount of FCB in stream. Therefore, the final FCB loads increased by 71.2% because of the growing peak channel velocity and volume of water used due to an increase in precipitation. Based on the results of MMES, we concluded that the level of FCB would increase simultaneously in the soil as well as in stream by the end of this century. This study will aid in understanding the future variability of FCB loads as well as in preparing an effective management plan for FCB levels in natural waters.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoliform bacteria 3afecal bacteria 3aprediction 3apublic health 3aseasonal variation 3asoil 3astream channels 3asurface water 3atemperature 3aweather 0aClimate change 0aFecal coliform bacteria 0aSoil and water assessment tool 0aFate and transport1 aLigaray, MayzoneeeauthoruSchool of Urban and Environmental Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan 44919, Republic of Korea1 aKim, MinjeongeauthoruSchool of Urban and Environmental Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan 44919, Republic of Korea1 aKim, GayoungeauthoruSchool of Urban and Environmental Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan 44919, Republic of Korea1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9136-056X1 aLee, GileauthoruSchool of Urban and Environmental Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan 44919, Republic of Korea1 aPachepsky, Yakov A.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Environmental Microbial and Food Safety Laboratory, 10300 Baltimore Avenue, Building 173, BARC-East, Beltsville, MD, 20705, USA1 aCha, Dong-HyuneauthoruSchool of Urban and Environmental Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan 44919, Republic of Korea1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5053-67411 aCho, Kyung HwaeauthoruSchool of Urban and Environmental Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan 44919, Republic of Korea0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Mar. 25, v. 658 p.753-762dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl445540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.2133Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4455b0048-9697  fScience of the total environment  aBatch:2138  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6062645309ExL  a2019-03-13  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/129796534493178462-00002-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0048969718350769.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6264530  a2021-01-21  a2021-01-2105094nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100023500180245010300415300001600518520196200534592002802496593001802524596006902542596019102611596007502802650001902877650001902896650002202915650001902937650001602956650001602972650001602988650001503004651001003019700015403029700012103183700017603304700018103480700015003661773011303811787003303924787001803957787002103975856008303996912001204079914004404091914002004135916001504155917001104170918002904181935002204210949001504232953006704247954005704314955003704371961001304408974001704421983001504438984001504453991578720690742620221120102500.0190816e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063816052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02393-x2doi  aagid:6381605-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, JieeauthoruState Key Laboratory of Water Resources & Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University, 299 Bayi Road, Wuchang Distinct, Wuhan, 430072, Hubei, China. jiechen@whu.edu.cn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8260-316010aBias correcting climate model multi-member ensembles to assess climate change impacts on hydrology  ap. 361-377.  aBias correction is usually applied to climate model outputs before they are used as inputs to environmental models for impact studies. Every climate model is post-processed independently of others to account for biases originating from model structure and internal variability. To better understand the role of internal variability, multi-member ensembles (multiple runs of a single climate model, with identical forcing but different initial conditions) have now become common in the modeling community. Bias correcting such ensembles requires specific considerations. Correcting all members of such an ensemble independently would force all of them to the target distribution, thus removing the signature of natural variability over the calibration period. How this undesirable effect would propagate onto subsequent time periods is unknown. This study proposes three bias correction variants of a multi-member ensemble and compares their performances against an independent correction of each individual member of the ensemble. The comparison is based on precipitation and temperature, as well as on resulting streamflows simulated by a hydrological model. Two multi-member ensembles (5-member CanESM2 and 10-member CSIRO-MK3.6) were used for a subtropical monsoon watershed in China. The results show that all bias correction methods reduce precipitation and temperature biases for all ensemble members. As expected, independent correction reduces the spread of each ensemble over the calibration period. This is, however, followed by an overestimation of the spread over the subsequent validation period. Pooling all members to calculate common bias correction factors produces the best results over the calibration period; however, the difference among three bias correction variants becomes less clear over the validation period due to internal variability, and even less so when considering streamflows, as the impact model adds its own uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a51779176, 51539009cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aB18037cthe Overseas Expertise Introduction Project for Discipline Innovation (111 Project) funded by Ministry of Education and State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs P.R.

This paper proposes a conceptual framework for ecological quality measurement based on current ecosystem functions and biodiverse habitat, compared with pixel-scale historical baselines. The framework was applied to evaluate the changes and driving factors of ecological quality for Chinese terrestrial ecosystems through remote sensing-based and ecosystem process modeled data at 1 km spatial resolution from 2000 to 2018. The results demonstrated the ecological quality index (EQI) had a very different spatial pattern based upon vegetation distribution. An upward trend in EQI was found over most areas, and variability of 46.95% in EQI can be explained well by change in climate, with an additional 10.64% explained by changing human activities, quantified by population density. This study demonstrated a practical and objective approach for quantifying and assessing ecological quality, which has application potential in ecosystem assessments on scales from local to region and nation, yet would provide a new scientific concept and paradigm for macro ecosystems management and decision-making by governments.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental management 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3apopulation density 3apopulation distribution 3aChina 0aEcosystem functions 0aClimate change 0aHuman activities 0aChinese terrestrial ecosystems1 aDing, YuefaneauthoruNational Ecosystem Science Data Center, Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China1 aWang, ShaoqiangeauthoruNational Ecosystem Science Data Center, Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China1 aWatson, Alan E.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Missoula, MT, 59801, USA1 aHe, HonglineauthoruNational Ecosystem Science Data Center, Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China1 aYe, HuieauthoruSchool of Tourism and Geography, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, 332005, China1 aOuyang, XihuangeauthoruSchool of Tourism and Geography, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, 332005, China1 aLi, YingnianeauthoruNorthwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xining, 810008, China0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 July 01, v. 313 p.114944-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)201840uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1149443Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:2018b0301-4797c313e114944  fJournal of environmental management  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6077244899ExL  a2022-04-04  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/152621049099972364-00004-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0301479722005175.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7724489  a2022-06-06  a2022-06-0605029nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100014300171245010100314520148200415592002801897593001801925650001201943650001901955650001201974650002201986650001902008650002202027650001502049650001902064650002102083650001502104650002602119650001102145650001602156651002402172651001802196653002402214653001902238653001502257653001502272653001502287653001502302653001602317653001802333700018802351700012202539700014102661700013602802700019102938700014003129700011703269700012803386773012703514787003303641787001803674787001903692856007303711912001203784914004303796914004003839916001503879917001103894918004303905935002203948949001503970953009303985954006004078955004204138961002004180974001704200983001504217984001504232991579657060742620221120123313.0200509e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058831062DNAL7 a10.1002/ehs2.12642doi  aagid:5883106-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMccollum, Daniel W.eauthoruRocky Mountain Research Station, USDA, Forest Service, 240 W.

We illustrate using scenarios of projected future conditions on rangelands in the Northern Great Plains and Desert Southwest of the United States. These two regions are different in the ways climate change is projected to affect the regions. Projection of a longer and warmer growing season in the Northern Great Plains could lead to increased forage production and land productivity. Highly uncertain effects on summer monsoons that primarily control rangeland productivity in the Desert Southwest, combined with the possibility of more intense and/or frequent drought events, could present land managers with challenges stemming from decreased forage production and land productivity. Climate projections, though uncertain, provide land managers with basic insight into future conditions they might encounter. They need more. A focus on vulnerability and resilience, with explicit recognition of interactions between ecological and socio‐economic factors, coupled with systematic monitoring and assessment of observable conditions on the land to supplement information based on climate projections, will more effectively provide critical and specific information managers need to adaptively manage rangelands under uncertain climate futures.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aforage production 3agrowing season 3aland productivity 3amonitoring 3amonsoon season 3arange management 3arangelands 3asocioeconomic factors 3asummer 3auncertainty 3aGreat Plains region 3aUnited States 0aadaptive management 0aclimate change 0aindicators 0amonitoring 0arangelands 0aresilience 0auncertainty 0avulnerability1 aTanaka, John A.eauthoruJames C.

These biologically diverse, transitional wetlands are defined by an abundance of grasses and periodic flooding, and maintained by regular disturbances such as grazing or cutting. This study summarizes relevant climate change scenarios projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and identifies implications for wet grasslands globally and regionally. Climate change is predicted to alter wet grassland hydrology, especially through warming, seasonal precipitation variability, and the severity of extreme events such as droughts and floods. Changes in the diversity, composition, and productivity of vegetation will affect functional and competitive relations between species. Extreme storm or flood events will favor ruderal plant species able to respond rapidly to environmental change. In some regions, wet grasslands may dry out during heatwaves and drought. C₄ grasses and invasive species could benefit from warming scenarios, the latter facilitated by disturbances such as droughts, floods, and possibly wildfires. Agriculture will be affected as forage available for livestock will likely become less reliable, necessitating adaptations to cutting and grazing regimes by farmers and conservation managers, and possibly leading to land abandonment. It is recommended that agri‐environment schemes, and other policies and practices, are adapted to mitigate climate change, with greater emphasis on water maintenance, flexible management, monitoring, and restoration of resilient wet grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aC4 plants 3aabandoned land 3aagri-environmental policy 3aclimate change 3acutting 3adrought 3aecosystems 3afarmers 3afloods 3aforage 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3ainvasive species 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3amonitoring 3astorms 3awetlands 3awildfires 0aagricultural production 0abiodiversity 0aclimate extremes 0adisturbance 0adrought 0aecosystem services 0aflooding 0amitigation 0aSpecial Feature: Wetlands and Global Climate and Land‐use Change 0awetland1 aSimpson, MattheweauthoruWWT Consulting, Slimbridge, Gloucestershire,  GL2 7BTUK1 aCasanova, MichelleeauthoruSchool of Applied and Biomedical Sciences, Federation University,  PO Box 663, Ballarat, Victoria,  3353Australia0 tEcosystem health and sustainability.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 2, no. 9 p.e01240-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23063x2332-88787nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2306340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ehs2.12403Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:23063b2332-8878c2d9ee01240  fEcosystem health and sustainability  aBatch:2238  aissued2 aTaylor & Francis Groupeprovider5DNAL  aIND6058831039ExL  a2019-07-02  a/data/metadata/incoming/taylorfrancis/tehs20_tehs20.v002.i09_20200416221148#20046796.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/taylorfrancis/ehs2.1240.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/taylorfrancis/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:5883103  a2020-05-09  a2020-09-2904168nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003700098035002800135040001800163100014000181245012900321300001400450520145100464592002801915593001801943650004401961650004102005650002802046650001302074650003002087650001202117650001902129650002702148650002402175650001302199650002102212650001502233650001502248650001502263650001902278650001102297650001402308651001202322653001302334653003502347653001902382653001302401653001502414653004202429700013702471700013502608773011302743787003302856787001802889787002102907856008402928912001203012914003103024914003403055916001503089917001103104918003603115935002203151949001503173953007003188954007103258955004503329961001303374974001703387983001503404984001503419991579751290742620221120122807.0190403e20170531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056418332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2017.02.0142doi  aagid:5641833-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallace, Carlington W.eauthoruDepartment of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA10aQuantifying the effects of conservation practice implementation on predicted runoff and chemical losses under climate change  ap. 51-65.  aThe Soil and Water Assessment Tool with downscaled weather data generated using the MarkSim weather file generator was used to evaluate the impact of long-term conservation practice implementation on runoff, sediment, atrazine, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses in an agricultural watershed located in northeastern Indiana. As part of the Conservation Effects Assessment Project, evaluation of these conservation practices is required to provide insight on how their implementation is benefiting the environment. The results indicate that individual conservation practices were effective in reducing a particular pollutant load, but combined practices were more effective in reducing multiple pollutant loads simultaneously. Of the individual best management practices (BMPs) assessed, no-till was the most effective in reducing multiple pollutant loads (reduced surface runoff by an average of 25%, sediment by 46%, atrazine by 46%, total N by 9%, soluble P by 16%, and total P by 29%). When BMPs were combined, pollutant load reductions were increased significantly (at α=0.05) for all pollutants, both under baseline and future climate scenarios. The reductions in runoff and pollutant loads for each decade of future climate ranged from 15 to 25% for surface runoff, 32–68% for sediment loss, 37–60% for atrazine loss, 5–13% for soluble N loss, 12–35% for total N loss, 9–41% for soluble P loss, and 33–60% for total P loss.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aConservation Effects Assessment Project 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aagricultural watersheds 3aatrazine 3abest management practices 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconservation practices 3ameteorological data 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3ano-tillage 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3apollution load 3arunoff 3asediments 3aIndiana 0aAtrazine 0aBest management practice (BMP) 0aClimate change 0aNitrogen 0aPhosphorus 0aSoil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)1 aFlanagan, Dennis C.eauthoruDepartment of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA1 aEngel, Bernard A.eauthoruDepartment of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 May 31, v. 186 p.51-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:1719  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6056418339ExL  a2019-04-03  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00067-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S0378377417300677.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:5641833  a2019-04-03  a2019-04-0303659nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100006300182245006100245300001600306520128800322592002801610593001801638650001701656650001901673650001401692650001801706650001301724650002101737650001601758650001001774650001601784650001801800650002301818650001201841651001301853653001801866653001901884653002201903653001701925653001401942653001201956700006601968700006802034700006202102700006602164700006402230773011002294787003302404787001802437787001902455856008502474912001202559914002902571914003502600916001502635917001102650918003602661935002202697949001502719953006002734954006102794955003502855961001202890974001702902983001502919984001502934991579788040742620221123022119.0180904e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053142392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2016.06.0052doi  aagid:5314239-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandt, LeslieeauthoruUSDA Forest Service, United States12aA framework for adapting urban forests to climate change  ap. 393-402.  aPlanting urban trees and expanding urban forest canopy cover are often considered key strategies for reducing climate change impacts in urban areas. However, urban trees and forests can also be vulnerable to climate change through shifts in tree habitat suitability, changes in pests and diseases, and changes in extreme weather events. We developed a three-step framework for urban forest vulnerability assessment and adaptation that scales from regional assessment to local on-the-ground action. We piloted this framework in the Chicago region in 10 locations representing an urban-exurban gradient across a range of socioeconomic capacities. The majority of trees across a seven-county region had low to moderate vulnerability, but many of the least vulnerable species were nonnative invasive species. Urban forests in the 10 pilot locations ranged in vulnerability largely due to differences in economic and organizational adaptive capacity. Adaptation actions selected in these locations tended to focus on increased biodiversity and restoration of natural disturbance regimes. However, adaptation actions in more developed sites also included incorporating new species or cultivars. Lessons learned from the pilot area can be used to inform future efforts in other urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3aforest canopy 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3anew species 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aurban forests 3avulnerable species 3aweather 3aIllinois 0aVulnerability 0aClimate change 0aAdaptive capacity 0aUrban forest 0aInventory 0aChicago1 aDerby Lewis, AbigaileauthoruThe Field Museum, United States1 aFahey, RoberteauthoruUniversity of Connecticut, United States1 aScott, LydiaeauthoruThe Morton Arboretum, United States1 aDarling, LindsayeauthoruThe Morton Arboretum, United States1 aSwanston, ChriseauthoruUSDA Forest Service, United States0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2016 Dec., v. 66 p.393-402dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1241340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2016.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:12413b1462-9011  fEnvironmental science & policy  aBatch:1717  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6053142399ExL  a2018-09-04  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/22-2-00074-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S146290111630291X.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:5314239  a2018-09-04  a2018-09-0404260nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004100097024002100138035002600159040001800185072000900203072000900212072000900221072000900230100001600239245016000255300001600415500002400431520183000455593001802285593002002303650001602323650001602339650001802355650001902373650001402392650001902406650003002425650002802455650001202483650002202495650002502517650002202542650001002564650001302574650000902587650002402596650001802620651001002638700001402648773010102662787001802763787003302781787003002814787002202844852000902866856011202875856009102987912001203078914004703090914004003137917001103177930003303188935002103221945002503242946001103267949001503278952005103293961001303344974001503357984001503372985010303387986001203490991579870010742620221123021513.0051027e20050831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437556362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2005.05.0052doi7 a10113/138202hdl  aagid:13820-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aJ800 0aX100 0aB2001 aZhang, X.C.10aSimulating potential response of hydrology, soil erosion, and crop productivity to climate change in Changwu tableland region on the Loess Plateau of China  ap. 127-142.  aIncludes references  aKnowledge of the impacts of climate change on agro-ecosystems is needed for developing optimal conservation and production practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential impacts of projected climate changes during 2070-2099 under three emissions scenarios (A2a, and B2a, and GGa1) on hydrology, soil loss, and crop production in Changwu tableland region on southern Loess Plateau of China. Monthly projections for the periods of 1950-1999 and 2070-2099 were used from the Hadley Centre's general circulation model (HadCM3). A stochastic weather generator (CLIGEN) was used to downscale monthly HadCM3 projections to daily values at three spatial scales. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was run for a wheat-wheat-maize rotation under conventional and conservation tillage at the 8.7% and 17.6% slopes. HadCM3 predicted a 23-37% increase in annual precipitation, 2.3-4.3 °C rise in maximum temperature, and 3.6-5.3 °C rise in minimum temperature for the region over the century. Compared with the present climate, predicted percent increases under climate changes, as averaged over the three spatial scales for each emissions scenario and slope, ranged from 29 to 79% for runoff, 2 to 81% for soil loss, 15 to 44% for wheat grain yield, 40 to 58% for maize yield, 25 to 28% for crop transpiration, 21 to 34% for soil evaporation, and 4 to 12% for long-term soil water reserve under the conventional tillage. However, adoption of the conservation (delayed) tillage could reduce runoff by 18-38%, and decrease soil loss by 56-68% as compared to the conventional tillage under the present climate. These results suggest that the use of the conservation tillage would be sufficient to maintain low runoff and erosion levels and thus protect agro-ecosystems under projected climate changes.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3agrain crops 3agrain yield 3awater erosion 3aclimate change 3ahydrology 3aagroecosystems 3asoil hydraulic properties 3aatmospheric circulation 3aweather 3asimulation models 3aconservation tillage 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3aZea mays 3acorn 3asoil erosion models 3atranspiration 3aChina1 aLiu, W.Z.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2005 Aug. 31, v.  131, no.  3-4 p.127-142x0168-19237nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl43250  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/138203Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2005.05.0053Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl43250b0168-1923c131d3-4e127  fAgricultural and forest meteorology  aissued  a20080428b20080502c00000000  aIND437556369ExL  aINDd2CTe2006/01/30  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20080428 20080502 00000000bIND 2CT 2006/01/30  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:13820  a2008-05-02  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a375563603399nab a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100017100171245010500342520128300447592002801730593001801758650002201776650001901798650001901817650002401836650001201860650003001872650002901902650001301931650001001944651002601954700003201980700003202012700003402044773012002078787003302198787001802231787001802249856007302267912001202340914003502352914001202387916001502399917001102414918006702425935002202492949001502514953007002529954007402599955004102673961001202714962004802726974001702774983001502791984001502806991579930430742620221121010244.0190702e20190402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064898352DNAL7 a10.3390/f100403022doi  aagid:6489835-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIverson, Louis  R.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science, Delaware, OH 43015, USA. liverson@fs.fed.us10aAnalysis of Climate Change Impacts on Tree Species of the Eastern US: Results of DISTRIB-II Modeling  aForests across the globe are faced with a rapidly changing climate and an enhanced understanding of how these changing conditions may impact these vital resources is needed. Our approach is to use DISTRIB-II, an updated version of the Random Forest DISTRIB model, to model 125 tree species individually from the eastern United States to quantify potential current and future habitat responses under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 8.5 -high emissions which is our current trajectory and RCP 4.5 -lower emissions by implementing energy conservation) and three climate models. Climate change could have large impacts on suitable habitat for tree species in the eastern United States, especially under a high emissions trajectory. On average, of the 125 species, approximately 88 species would gain and 26 species would lose at least 10% of their suitable habitat. The projected change in the center of gravity for each species distribution (i.e., mean center) between current and future habitat moves generally northeast, with 81 species habitat centers potentially moving over 100 km under RCP 8.5. Collectively, our results suggest that many species will experience less pressure in tracking their suitable habitats under a path of lower greenhouse gas emissions.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acenter of gravity 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aenergy conservation 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahabitats 3atrees 3aEastern United States1 aPeters, Matthew  P.eauthor1 aPrasad, Anantha  M.eauthor1 aMatthews, Stephen  N.eauthor0 tForests.g2019 Apr. 02, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)225740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f100403023Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:2257b1999-4907c10d4  fForests  aBatch:2278  aissued2 aMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing Instituteeprovider5DNAL  aIND6064898359ExL  a2019-08-12  a/data/metadata/incoming/mdpinstitute/forests-v10-i04-20190429.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/forests-v10-i04-20190429.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2278 reviewed on 2019-08-12T12:00:04Z  aagid:6489835  a2019-07-02  a2019-08-1205840nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003800097035002700135040001800162100016800180245011500348300001600463520264500479592002803124593001803152650001803170650001103188650001903199650002303218650003303241650001703274650002203291650002003313650002103333650001503354650002203369650001203391650001103403650001903414650002203433650001803455650001303473650000903486651001203495700016103507700017403668700017703842700012304019700025304142700012704395773009804522787003304620787001804653787002104671856008404692912001204776914004104788914003404829917001104863918003404874935002104908949001504929953003304944961001204977962004804989962004705037974001605084983001505100984001505115991580130480742620221123044036.0141111e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447279752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2012.06.0162doi  aagid:518560-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColombo, Stephen J.eauthoruOntario Forest Research Institute, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, 1235 Queen Street East, Sault Ste.

We explore the effects of management strategies on tradeoffs between forest C stocks and ecological sustainability under five scenarios, three of which included management and two scenarios which provide baselines emulating the natural forest. Managed forest scenarios were: (a) Protection (PROT), i.e., management by suppression of natural disturbance and harvest exclusion; (b) Harvest at a higher rate removing all sustainably available wood (HHARV); (c) Harvest at the lower historical average rate of harvest, AHARV. Both harvest scenarios reflected current forest management practices in the study area, including suppression of natural disturbance and a large (>20% of total) forest area reserved from harvest. Scenarios (d) and (e) simulated “natural” forest with unsuppressed fire at higher (NDH) or lower (NDL) levels and no harvest. Ecological sustainability was evaluated using a coarse filter approach where forest age class and tree species composition were indicators of condition. The study area encompassed 3.4 million hectares of forest in northeastern Ontario at the interface between the temperate hardwood and boreal forest zones. Future forest condition for each scenario was modeled using a timber supply model (SFMM), and C stored in forests and wood products were estimated using the FORCARB-ON model. Forest protection (PROT) resulted in greatest forest C stocks, especially in the near term, but was within 95% of its maximum, becoming saturated within 30years. Harvesting (HHARV and AHARV) resulted in less forest C stock compared to PROT, however, after 100years of adding C in wood products to that in regenerating forests total C storage was equivalent or greater than forest C with PROT. In contrast, removing management (NDH and NDL) decreased C relative to any of the management regimes, though in NDL the decrease was delayed for 30years compared to HHARV. Forest sustainability measured by similarity to natural forest age class was superior with HHARV and AHARV compared to PROT, although no management regime produced a fully natural result. PROT in particular largely lacked younger age classes. All management regimes produced species composition that was near or within the range of natural variation. This analysis provides an example of the types of tradeoffs that can be considered in evaluating the contribution of forests to climate change mitigation, either in a commercial forestry context or in an approach based on protected areas.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aage structure 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aconservation areas 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aforest fires 3aforest management 3aforest reserves 3ahardwood forests 3aharvesting 3aindicator species 3alogging 3amodels 3arisk reduction 3aspecies diversity 3atimber supply 3atree age 3awood 3aOntario1 aChen, JiaxineauthoruOntario Forest Research Institute, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, 1235 Queen Street East, Sault Ste.

This information is important to have in order to most efficiently guide the breeding of crops that are adapted to new climatic conditions. A maize (Zea mays) gene microarray, a method used worldwide to evaluate the expression of tens of thousands of genes at once, was used to investigate changes in expression of genes involved in resistance to heat and water stress in milk stage popcorn kernels from undamaged and insect-damaged ears. Popcorn is a form of maize that is more susceptible to heat and drought stress due to its smaller root system. In years of heat and drought stress, expression of many heat shock- and senescence-related proteins increased compared to the year when weather was closer to average conditions, but the expression of many genes related to drought stress resistance decreased in years of weather stress. A different complex of heat shock protein and water stress resistance protein genes had higher expression in kernels from undamaged compared to insect-damaged ears in years of heat and drought stress. These results indicate that the interaction of biotic components, such as insects, are important to consider in developing crop lines with adaptation to stress as this will help identify additional genes and their regulatory components involved in heat and drought stress resistance that might otherwise be overlooked, and will likely be an important strategy for the most effective development of climate stress-tolerant crops globally.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a3620-42000-047-00DcUSDA, Agricultural Research Service 3aZea mays 3abreeding 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acrop production 3acrops 3acultivars 3aears 3afilling period 3agene expression 3aheat 3aheat shock proteins 3ainsects 3amicroarray technology 3apopcorn 3aresistance genes 3aroot systems 3aseeds 3astress tolerance 3awater stress 3aweather1 aJohnson, Eric T.eauthoruCrop Bioprotection Research Unit, United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, 1815 North University Street, Peoria, IL, 61604, USA0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2018 Oct., v. 23, no. 7 p.1063-1081dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870070x1381-23867nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl387007040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-017-9772-x3Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3870070b1381-2386c23d7e1063  fMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change  aBatch:2070  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6060909359ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-09-03_09-51-40.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/11027-23-7.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:2070 reviewed on 2018-09-27T16:00:03Z  aBatch:2070 reviewed on 2018-09-28T16:00:03Z  aagid:6090935  a2018-09-04  a2020-03-0604134nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002600098035002800124040001800152100012900170245009500299300001600394500002000410520116400430592002801594593001801622650002301640650001201663650001901675650002601694650001601720650002101736650002201757650002301779650002401802650001301826650001401839650001301853651001501866700010901881700011301990700011302103700009402216700008802310700011602398700011602514700012002630773013602750787003302886787001802919787001902937856007302956912001203029914004103041914004503082917001103127918004303138935002203181949001503203952001903218953005703237954006103294955003403355961001203389974001703401983001503418984001503433991580657610742620221123032809.0220503e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077626832DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.24502doi  aagid:7762683-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Gavin MeauthoruUS Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Albuquerque, NM10aForest restoration limits megafires and supports species conservation under climate change  ap. 210-216.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate change and fire suppression have altered disturbance regimes in forest ecosystems globally. In the seasonally dry forests of western North America, large‐scale restoration may reduce severe fire and increase forest resilience but also eliminate existing habitat for sensitive wildlife species. We modeled bioregional‐scale effects of forest restoration on future severe fire activity and occupancy dynamics of an old‐forest species declining in abundance, the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis), in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Our findings suggest restoring historical forest structure may mitigate severe fire activity as the climate warms, particularly when restoration occurs in owl habitat. On average, benefits provided by restoration to owls (reduced severe fire) were found to exceed potential costs (direct habitat alteration) by mid‐century. However, the magnitude and direction of restoration trade‐offs varied spatially, which informs restoration planning. When large, old trees are maintained, forest restoration can provide co‐benefits to old‐forest species and forest ecosystem resilience under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aStrix occidentalis 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecological resilience 3aenvironment 3afire suppression 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest restoration 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3amountains 3awildlife 3aCalifornia1 aKeyser, Alisa ReauthoruSierra Nevada Research Institute, University of California–Merced, Merced, CA1 aWesterling, A LeroyeauthoruSierra Nevada Research Institute, University of California–Merced, Merced, CA1 aBaldwin, W JonathaneauthoruSierra Nevada Research Institute, University of California–Merced, Merced, CA1 aKeane, John JeauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station, Davis, CA1 aSawyer, Sarah CeauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region, Vallejo, CA1 aClare, John DJeauthoruDepartment of Forest & Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, WI1 aGutiérrez, RJeauthoruDepartment of Forest & Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, WI1 aPeery, M ZachariaheauthoruDepartment of Forest & Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, WI0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2022 May, v. 20, no. 4 p.210-216dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2308340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.24503Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:23083b1540-9295c20d4e210  fFrontiers in ecology and the environment  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6077626839ExL  a2022-06-03  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/15409295_2022_20_4.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/15409295_2022_20_4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7762683  a2022-05-03  a2022-06-0304425nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100011800171245010500289300001800394500001900412500002000431520154100451592002801992593001802020596002302038596002402061650001702085650000902102650001302111650001502124650002002139700014502159700009902304700010102403700009802504700014902602700012402751700010802875700014602983773012303129787003303252787001803285787002203303856007303325912001203398914004503410914002603455916001603481917001103497918004303508935002203551949001503573953005703588954006103645955003403706961001203740974001703752983001503769984001503784991580706080742620221122234330.0210320e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073158702DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.155102doi  aagid:7315870-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrighenti, StefanoeauthoruFaculty of Science and Technology, Free University of Bozen‐Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy10aRock glaciers and related cold rocky landforms: Overlooked climate refugia for mountain biodiversity  ap. 1504-1517.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMountains are global biodiversity hotspots where cold environments and their associated ecological communities are threatened by climate warming. Considerable research attention has been devoted to understanding the ecological effects of alpine glacier and snowfield recession. However, much less attention has been given to identifying climate refugia in mountain ecosystems where present‐day environmental conditions will be maintained, at least in the near‐term, as other habitats change. Around the world, montane communities of microbes, animals, and plants live on, adjacent to, and downstream of rock glaciers and related cold rocky landforms (CRL). These geomorphological features have been overlooked in the ecological literature despite being extremely common in mountain ranges worldwide with a propensity to support cold and stable habitats for aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. CRLs are less responsive to atmospheric warming than alpine glaciers and snowfields due to the insulating nature and thermal inertia of their debris cover paired with their internal ventilation patterns. Thus, CRLs are likely to remain on the landscape after adjacent glaciers and snowfields have melted, thereby providing longer‐term cold habitat for biodiversity living on and downstream of them. Here, we show that CRLs will likely act as key climate refugia for terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity in mountain ecosystems, offer guidelines for incorporating CRLs into conservation practices, and identify areas for future research.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aOPP‐1906015cNSF  cU.S. Forest Service 3abiodiversity 3acold 3aglaciers 3alandscapes 3arefuge habitats1 aHotaling, ScotteauthoruSchool of Biological Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5965-09861 aFinn, Debra S.eauthoruDepartment of Biology, Missouri State University, Springfield, MO, USA1 aFountain, Andrew G.eauthoruDepartment of Geology, Portland State University, Portland, OR, USA1 aHayashi, MasakieauthoruDepartment of Geoscience, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada1 aHerbst, DavideauthoruSierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory and Institute of Marine Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA1 aSaros, Jasmine E.eauthoruSchool of Biology and Ecology, Climate Change Institute, University of Maine, Orono, ME, USA1 aTronstad, Lusha M.eauthoruWyoming Natural Diversity Database, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, USA1 aMillar, Constance I.eauthoruPacific Southwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Albany, CA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1761-00270 tGlobal change biology.g2021 Apr., v. 27, no. 8 p.1504-1517dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.155103Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c27d8e1504  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:10149  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6073158709ExL  a2021-06-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13541013_2021_27_8.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13541013_2021_27_8.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7315870  a2021-03-20  a2021-06-1805604nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100022700171245012400398300001600522500001400538500002000552520213000572592002802702593001802730596005302748596007602801596003102877596002702908650001902935650001202954650001902966650001302985650001202998650001403010650002203024650001403046650002303060650001503083650001603098650002603114650001503140650001303155650001503168650001003183651001803193700022803211700014203439700020303581700022603784700015604010773012704166787003304293787001804326787002404344856007304368912001204441914004604453914003004499916001504529917001104544918004304555935002204598949001504620953005704635954006104692955003404753961001204787974001704799983001504816984001504831991580730530742620221120235534.0210118e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072392912DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.131912doi  aagid:7239291-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBisbing, Sarah M.eauthoruDepartment of Natural Resources & Environmental Science, Program in Ecology, Evolution, & Conservation Biology, University of Nevada ‐ Reno, Reno, NV, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5534-935210aCan long‐lived species keep pace with climate change? Evidence of local persistence potential in a widespread conifer  ap. 296-312.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Climate change poses significant challenges for tree species, which are slow to adapt and migrate. Insight into genetic and phenotypic variation under current landscape conditions can be used to gauge persistence potential to future conditions and determine conservation priorities, but landscape effects have been minimally tested in trees. Here, we use Pinus contorta, one of the most widely distributed conifers in North America, to evaluate the influence of landscape heterogeneity on genetic structure as well as the magnitude of local adaptation versus phenotypic plasticity in a widespread tree species. LOCATION: Western North America. METHODS: We paired landscape genetics with fully reciprocal in situ common gardens to evaluate landscape influence on neutral and adaptive variation across all subspecies of P. contorta. RESULTS: Landscape barriers alone play a minor role in limiting gene flow, creating marginal geographically‐based structure. Local climate determines population performance, with survival highest at home but growth greatest in mild climates (e.g., warm, wet). Survival of two of the three populations tested was consistent with patterns of local adaptation documented for P. contorta, while growth was indicative of plasticity for populations grown under novel conditions and suggesting that some populations are not currently occupying their climatic optimum. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insight into the role of the landscape in shaping population genetic structure in a widespread tree species as well as the potential response of local populations to novel conditions, knowledge critical to understanding how widely distributed species may respond to climate change. Geographically based genetic structure and reduced survival under water‐limited conditions may make some populations of widespread tree species more vulnerable to local maladaptation and extirpation. However, genetically diverse and phenotypically plastic populations of widespread trees, such as many of the P. contorta populations sampled and tested here, likely possess high persistence potential.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aGloria Barron FellowshipcThe Wilderness Society  aGeorge Melendez Wright Climate Change FellowshipcNational Park Service  cUS Army Corps of Engineers  cEngineering Laboratory 3aPinus contorta 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconifers 3agardens 3agene flow 3agenetic structure 3aknowledge 3alandscape genetics 3alandscapes 3amethodology 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aplasticity 3aplastics 3apopulation 3atrees 3aNorth America1 aUrza, Alexandra K.eauthoruDepartment of Natural Resources & Environmental Science, Program in Ecology, Evolution, & Conservation Biology, University of Nevada ‐ Reno, Reno, NV, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9795-67351 aBuma, Brian J.eauthoruDepartment of Integrative Biology, University of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2402-77371 aCooper, David J.eauthoruDepartment of Forest and Rangeland Stewardship & Graduate Degree Program in Ecology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3391-35381 aMatocq, MarjorieeauthoruDepartment of Natural Resources & Environmental Science, Program in Ecology, Evolution, & Conservation Biology, University of Nevada ‐ Reno, Reno, NV, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4829-37491 aAngert, Amy L.eauthoruDepartments of Botany and Zoology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3082-01330 tDiversity & distributions.g2021 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.296-312dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl386707140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.131913Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3867071b1366-9516c27d2e296  fDiversity & distributions  aBatch:2644  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6072392919ExL  a2021-03-01  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13669516_2021_27_2.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13669516_2021_27_2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7239291  a2021-01-18  a2021-03-0105138nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100033200179245009400511300001400605500001100619520185300630592002802483593001802511650001902529650001902548650001902567650002502586650001702611650001802628650001902646650002102665650000902686650002002695650001202715650001802727650001302745650001602758650001002774650001702784650002502801650001502826650001202841650003102853700023002884700023903114700023803353700015203591773012003743787003303863787001803896787002403914856008203938912001204020914004504032914002704077916001504104917001104119918002904130935002204159949001504181953006704196954005604263955003704319961001304356974001704369983001504386984001504401991580916590742620221122233110.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059094322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-017-9508-22doi  aagid:5909432-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaughan, MarthaM.eauthoruMycotoxin Prevention and Applied Microbiology Research Unit, National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, 1815 N University St, Peoria, IL, 61604, USA.

Climate changes are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of both abiotic and biotic stress. Protective phytochemicals play an important role in both abiotic stress resilience and resistance to biotic challenges, yet the concentration and composition of these phytochemicals are also dependent on climate variables. We review the research on the effects of climate change associated abiotic stresses on three classes of maize defense metabolites, including benzoxazinoids, volatile organic compounds, and terpenoid phytoalexins. Despite significant knowledge gaps that still exist, it is evident that climate change will influence maize phytochemicals associated with resilient productivity. While broad generalizations are not yet possible, climate induced changes in phytochemicals are context specific and dependent upon developmental stage and tissue type. Under conditions of drought, maize modulates different classes of defense phytochemicals to protect the above-and belowground tissues. Aboveground the benzoxazinoid defenses are stimulated, but belowground terpenoid phytoalexins are predominantly deployed. Changes in the allocation or distribution of the different classes of defense metabolites or signaling molecules have the potential to further shape the biodiversity and abundance of pests within the maize agroecosystem. A better understanding of the underlying genetics, biosynthetic pathways, regulation and precise biological roles of maize phytochemicals modulated by arrays of climatic conditions will be required to ensure optimal plant resilience and productivity in the face of combined biotic and abiotic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aabiotic stress 3aagroecosystems 3abenzoxazinoids 3abiochemical pathways 3abiodiversity 3abiotic stress 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acorn 3acrop production 3adrought 3afood security 3agenetics 3ametabolites 3apests 3aphytoalexins 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aterpenoids 3atissues 3avolatile organic compounds1 aBlock, AnnaeauthoruChemistry Research Unit, Center of Medical, Agricultural, and Veterinary Entomology, United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, 1600 SW 23rd Drive, Gainesville, FL, 32608, USA1 aChristensen, ShawnA.eauthoruChemistry Research Unit, Center of Medical, Agricultural, and Veterinary Entomology, United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, 1600 SW 23rd Drive, Gainesville, FL, 32608, USA1 aAllen, LeonHartwelleauthoruChemistry Research Unit, Center of Medical, Agricultural, and Veterinary Entomology, United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, 1600 SW 23rd Drive, Gainesville, FL, 32608, USA1 aSchmelz, EricA.eauthoruSection of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA0 tPhytochemistry reviews.g2018 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.37-49dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870073x1568-77677nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl387007340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-017-9508-23Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3870073b1568-7767c17d1e37  fPhytochemistry reviews  aBatch:1974  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6059094329ExL  a2018-06-19  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-03-08_06-19-47.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/11101-17-1.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:5909432  a2018-06-19  a2018-06-1904529nab a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100012700179245010700306300001600413520140100429592002801830593001801858650001901876650002101895650003301916650001701949650001301966650001801979650001401997650001602011651001102027700012802038700014002166700011702306700012602423700024402549700016402793700031202957773010803269787003303377787001803410787002203428856008203450912001203532914004403544914001603588916001503604917001103619918002903630935002203659949001503681953006703696954005603763955003703819961001203856974001703868983001503885984001503900991581015280742620221120060448.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059297722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11056-017-9620-62doi  aagid:5929772-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastellanos-Acuña, DanteeauthoruDepartment of Renewable Resources, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2H1, Canada10aClimate-based seed zones for Mexico: guiding reforestation under observed and projected climate change  ap. 297-309.  aSeed zones for forest tree species are a widely used tool in reforestation programs to ensure that seedlings are well adapted to their planting environments. Here, we propose a climate-based seed zone system for Mexico to address observed and projected climate change. The proposed seed zone classification is based on bands of climate variables often related to genetic adaptation of tree species: mean coldest month temperature (MCMT) and an aridity index (AHM). The overlay of the MCMT and AHM for the 1961–1990 period resulted in 63 climate-based zones. Climate change observed over the last three decades has resulted in an increase of + 0.74 °C for MCMT and a shift toward overall drier conditions across Mexico. By the 2050s, MCMT is expected to increase by + 1.7 °C and AHM shifts further towards drier conditions. We recommend moving seed sources from warm, dry locations towards currently wetter and cooler planting sites, to compensate for climate change that has already occurred and is expected to continue for the next decades. We contribute a straight-forward climate-based seed zone system that allows practitioners to match seed procurement regions with planting regions under observed and anticipated climate change. Our transfer recommendations using climate-based zones can be implemented within the existing seed zone system, which often span large climate gradients.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adry environmental conditions 3aforest trees 3aplanting 3areforestation 3aseedlings 3atemperature 3aMexico1 aVance-Borland, KennethW.eauthoruThe Conservation Planning Institute, 8285 NW Wynoochee Dr, Corvallis, OR, 97330-2878, USA1 aSt. Clair, J.BradleyeauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR, 97331, USA1 aHamann, AndreaseauthoruDepartment of Renewable Resources, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2H1, Canada1 aLópez-Upton, JaviereauthoruPostgrado en Ciencias Forestales, Colegio de Postgraduados, 56230, Texcoco, México, Mexico1 aGómez-Pineda, ErikaeauthoruInstituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias y Forestales, Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo (IIAF-UMSNH), Av.

However, the impacts of climate change on forest communities are mostly unknown. Here, we assess changes to forest communities at three scales: within‐community changes in species composition, individual community spatial shifts and changes across all communities. LOCATION: Eastern USA. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Forest tree species. METHODS: Using a region‐wide forest inventory dataset from the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis Program with > 70,000 plots, we identified forest communities using the latent Dirichlet allocation method. We analysed changes in species composition within communities and assessed community‐level spatial shifts over the last three decades to quantify the responses of individual communities to climate change. We used the distribution of forest communities across climate conditions to predict where communities could migrate to during the study period and compared climate‐predicted shifts with observed community shifts. Changes across all communities were modelled as a function of climatic and non‐climatic variables using generalized linear mixed‐effects models. RESULTS: We identified 12 regional forest communities of the eastern USA, which varied in their stability of species composition over the study period. All communities experienced relatively short yet significant shifts in their spatial distribution (median = 8.0 km/decade). Historical climate and changes in seasonal temperature variability were the best predictors of change across all communities. However, the distance and direction of individual community migration were poorly predicted by climate change, and the observed direction was often the opposite of the predicted direction. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Forest communities shifted their distributions over the last three decades, but climate change outpaced the rate of community migration. Continued lags between climate change and forest community responses and the lack of migration in the direction predicted by climate change might lead to the inability of forests to keep up with changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006959  cPurdue Climate Change Research Center  a11207356cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  a19‐JV‐11242305‐102cU.S. Forest Service  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cForest Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUSDA Forest Service 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3aforest communities 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest inventory 3aforest trees 3aforests 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aEastern United States1 aJenkins, Michael A.eauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Natural Resources, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1612-63831 aOswalt, Christopher M.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, Knoxville, Tennessee1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8183-76511 aFei, SonglineauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Natural Resources, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2772-01660 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2020 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.1299-1314dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl392018040uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.131023Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3920180b1466-822Xc29d8e1299  fGlobal ecology and biogeography  aBatch:2617  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6070166139ExL  a2020-12-10  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/1466822X_2020_29_8.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/1466822X_2020_29_8.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7016613  a2020-07-13  a2020-12-1004264nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004400098024004100142035002800183040001800211100014500229245009100374300001600465520124400481592002801725593001801753596006001771650002001831650001901851650002401870650001501894650002601909650001201935650001501947650001301962650001101975650001501986650002202001650001402023650002202037651001102059653001902070653003702089653003202126653002402158653001302182700013502195700012502330700014602455700012802601700012702729773012302856787003302979787001803012787002103030856008803051912001203139914004103151914002503192916001403217917001103231918003603242935002203278949001503300953006003315954006103375955003503436961001203471974001703483983001503500984001503515991581256460742620221121042437.0190319e20130924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011163762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.07.0032chorus7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.07.0032doi  aagid:1116376-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalofsky, Jessica E.eauthoruSchool of Environmental and Forest Sciences, University of Washington, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195-2100, USA10aAssessing potential climate change effects on vegetation using a linked model approach  ap. 131-143.  aWe developed a process that links the mechanistic power of dynamic global vegetation models with the detailed vegetation dynamics of state-and-transition models to project local vegetation shifts driven by projected climate change. We applied our approach to central Oregon (USA) ecosystems using three climate change scenarios to assess potential future changes in species composition and community structure. Our results suggest that: (1) legacy effects incorporated in state-and-transition models realistically dampen climate change effects on vegetation; (2) species-specific response to fire built into state-and-transition models can result in increased resistance to climate change, as was the case for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests, or increased sensitivity to climate change, as was the case for some shrublands and grasslands in the study area; and (3) vegetation could remain relatively stable in the short term, then shift rapidly as a consequence of increased disturbance such as wildfire and altered environmental conditions. Managers and other land stewards can use results from our linked models to better anticipate potential climate-induced shifts in local vegetation and resulting effects on wildlife habitat.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cWestern Wildland Environmental Threat Assessment Center 3aPinus ponderosa 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3agrasslands 3amanagers 3amodels 3ashrublands 3aspecies diversity 3awildfires 3awildlife habitats 3aOregon 0aClimate change 0aDynamic global vegetation models 0aState-and-transition models 0aVegetation dynamics 0aWildfire1 aHemstrom, Miles A.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Forestry Sciences Laboratory, 620 SW Main St., Suite 400, Portland, OR 97205, USA1 aConklin, David R.eauthoruConservation Biology Institute, 136 SW Washington Avenue, Suite 202, Corvallis, OR 97333, USA1 aHalofsky, Joshua S.eauthoruWashington Department of Natural Resources, PO Box 47000, 1111 Washington Street SE, Olympia, WA 98504-7000, USA1 aKerns, Becky K.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Forestry Sciences Laboratory, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA1 aBachelet, DominiqueeauthoruConservation Biology Institute, 136 SW Washington Avenue, Suite 202, Corvallis, OR 97333, USA0 tEcological modelling.g2013 Sept. 24, v. 266 p.131-143dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl619140uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl6191b0304-3800c266e131  fEcological modelling  aBatch:786  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6011163769ExL  a2019-03-19  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00052-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0304380013003281.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:1116376  a2019-03-19  a2022-10-0403987nab a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003700098035002800135040001800163100018400181245010000365300001400465500001500479520143600494592002801930593001801958650001501976650001901991650001302010650001202023650001502035653001202050653002202062653001102084653001702095653002802112700015602140700013902296700014302435700012002578773010902698787003302807787001802840787001902858856008302877912001202960914003602972914003603008916001503044917001103059918003603070935002203106949001503128953007003143954007103213955004503284961000903329974001703338983001503355984001503370991581370770742620221122021039.0190417e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052812202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2015.11.0112doi  aagid:5281220-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguiar, Ludmilla M.S.eauthoruDepartmento de Zoologia, Universidade de Brasilia, Campus Darcy Ribeiro, CEP: 70910-900, Brasilia, DF, Brazil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9180-505210aShould I stay or should I go? Climate change effects on the future of Neotropical savannah bats  ap. 22-33.  a2019-12-06  aMost extant species are survivors of the last climate change event 20,000 years ago. While past events took place over thousands of years, current climate change is occurring much faster, over a few decades. We modelled the potential distribution area of bat species in the Brazilian Cerrado, a Neotropical savannah, and assessed the potential impacts of climate change up to 2050 in two scenarios. First we evaluated what the impact on the distributions of bat species would be if they were unable to move to areas where climate conditions might be similar to current ones. The novelty of our paper is that, based on least-cost-path analyses, we identified potential corridors that could be managed now to mitigate potential impacts of climate change. Our results indicate that on average, in the future bat species would find similar climate conditions 281 km southeast from current regions. If bat species were not able to move to new suitable areas and were unable to adapt, then 36 species (31.6%) could lose >80% of their current distribution area, and five species will lose more than 98% of their distribution area in the Brazilian Cerrado. In contrast, if bat species are able to reach such areas, then the number of highly impacted species will be reduced to nine, with none of them likely to disappear from the Cerrado. We present measures that could be implemented immediately to mitigate future climate change impacts.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aChiroptera 3aclimate change 3asavannas 3acerrado 3aNeotropics 0aecology 0aBrazilian Cerrado 0aBrazil 0aConservation 0aEcological niche models1 aBernard, EnricoeauthoruDepartamento de Zoologia, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Av.

The soil and water resources contained in this region have historically supported highly diverse and productive agriculture enterprises that provide a significant proportion of the food, feed, and oilseed for the nation. The region also provides ecological services that influence air, water, and soil quality along with biological diversity. Combined with livestock production and a biofuel industry, crop production forms an integrated system that can offer producers flexibility in management decisions. Projected climatic changes for this region include increasing atmospheric CO₂, a longer, warmer growing season, and increased precipitation, likely received in more frequent extreme events. These changes will impact soil and water resources in the region and create opportunities and challenges for land managers. The objectives of this paper are to describe anticipated impacts of projected mid-(2050) and late-(2085) climatic changes on crop production systems in the Northern Great Plains and provide adaptation strategies that should be developed to take advantage of positive and mitigate negative changes. Projected climatic changes will influence agricultural productivity directly as well as indirectly due to changes in weed pressure, insect populations, and diseases. A warmer, longer growing season will change the crops and distribution of those crops grown within the region. An increase in the number of extreme temperature events (high daytime highs or nighttime lows) will decrease crop yields due to increased plant stress during critical pollination and grain fill periods. Adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability of soil and water resources to projected climatic changes include increasing cropping intensity, reducing tillage intensity, and use of cover crops to provide surface cover to reduce erosion potential and improve nutrient and water use efficiency. Increased use of perennial forages, crop residue, and failed crops in integrated crop-livestock systems will add biological diversity and provide options for converting vegetation biomass into animal protein. Socio-economic changes will need to be incorporated into adaptation strategies planning to insure that sustaining ecosystem services and meeting desired production and conservation goals is accomplished. Education and extension services will be needed to transfer adaptive knowledge in a timely manner to producers in the field.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a1418baallenc2017-08-11dmanager-lgarnere2017-08-16  eARIS manuscript 3aagribusiness 3aagricultural productivity 3aair 3aanimal proteins 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abiodiversity 3abioenergy industry 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acover crops 3acrop residues 3acrop yield 3acropland 3aecosystem services 3aextension education 3afilling period 3aforage 3agrowing season 3ainsects 3aintegrated agricultural systems 3alivestock production 3aoilseeds 3aplanning 3aplant stress 3apollination 3aproduction technology 3asocioeconomics 3asoil 3asoil quality 3atemperature 3atillage 3avegetation 3awater resources 3awater use efficiency 3aweeds 3aColorado 3aGreat Plains region 3aMontana 3aNebraska 3aNorth Dakota 3aSouth Dakota 3aWyoming1 aVigil, MerleF.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, 40335 County Road GG, Akron, CO, 80720, USA1 aHendrickson, JohnR.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Box 459, Mandan, ND, 58554, USA1 aDerner, JustinD.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, 8408 Hildreth Road, Cheyenne, WY, 82009, USA0 tClimatic change.g2018 Jan., v. 146, no. 1-2 p.219-230dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/57630813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-1989-x3Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009e1  fClimatic change  aBatch:1832  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6057630819ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-01-31_05-58-48.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-146-1-2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/10.1007%252Fs10584-017-1989-x.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission, eISSN 1573-1480  aBatch:1832 reviewed on 2017-10-16T13:00:03Z  aagid:5763081  aArticle missing volume number  a2018-06-19  a2020-03-06  ans1292301608nab a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002500097035002800122040001800150072001700168072001700185100002700202245004600229300001600275593001800291650002000309650001800329650001800347650001200365650001900377650001700396650002300413650001300436650002300449650001100472773007000483787003300553787001800586787002200604852000900626856007500635912001200710914002100722914001100743917001100754930003300765935002100798945002500819946001100844952005100855961001300906974001700919984001500936985010300951986001201054991581586520742620221120092549.0100728e20100408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444049962DNAL7 a10.1038/464843a2doi  aagid:3127231-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Using PRISM climate and productivity data measured on a grid of 3356 plots, we developed a simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model to estimate the impacts of climate change on potential productivity of Pacific Northwest (PNW) forests of the United States. Productivity, measured by projected potential mean annual increment (PMAI) at culmination, is explained by the interaction of annual temperature, precipitation, and precipitation in excess of evapotranspiration through the growing season. By utilizing information regarding spatial error in the SAR model, the resulting spatial bias is reduced thereby improving the accuracy of the resulting maps. The model, coupled with climate change output from four generalized circulation models, was used to predict the productivity impacts of four different scenarios derived from the fourth IPCC special report on emissions, representing different future economic and environmental states of the world, viz., scenario A1B, A2, B1 (low growth, high economic development and low energy usage), and COMMIT. In these scenarios, regional average temperature is expected to increase from 0.5 to 4.5°C, while precipitation shows no clear trend over time. For the west and east side of the Cascade Mountains, respectively, PMAI increases: 7% and 20% under A1B scenario; 8% and 23% under scenario A2; 5% and 15% under scenario B1, and 2% and 5% under the COMMIT scenario. These projections should be viewed as potential changes in productivity, since they do not reflect the mitigating effects of any shifts in management or public policy. For managers and policy makers, the results suggest the relative magnitude of effects and the potential variability of impacts across a range of climate scenarios.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aequations 3aforest yields 3aglobal warming 3astatistical models 3aforest health 3aCascade Mountain region 3aNorthwestern United States 0amean annual increment 0asite classes 0asimultaneous autoregressive models 0aproductivity1 aTemesgen, Hailemariam1 aAdams, Darius1 aBarrett, Tara0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Feb. 5, v.  259, no.  4 p.720-729dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl9013  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/377993Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.09.0033Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl9013b0378-1127c259d4e720  fForest ecology and management  aissued  a20100125b20100205c00000000  aIND443136499ExL  aINDdLYNe2010/01/25  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20100125 20100205 00000000bIND LYN 2010/01/25  aUSDA/FS  aagid:37799  a2011-03-19  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a431364905488nab a2200985 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003800097024002200135024001900157024002100176035002600197040001800223072000900241072000900250072000900259072000900268100012400277245013200401246002800533500001500561506007600576520165000652592002802302593001802330593002002348506003702368650001902405650002202424650001802446650001902464650000802483650002002491650001902511650002302530650002402553650001102577650002402588650001702612650002002629650000902649650000902658650001202667650002502679651001302704651001302717651001302730651001002743653001802753653001902771653001602790700011302806700010802919700009603027700019003123700012803313700011503441700006303556773007303619787001803692787003303710787003003743787002403773852000903797856011203806856008803918912001204006914004604018914001304064917001104077918004604088930003304134935002104167945002504188949001504213952005104228953001704279961001304296962004804309974001504357984001504372985010304387986001204490991581604890742620221207064146.0091110e20090803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442850652DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00064872doi7 aPMC27151042pmcid7 a196492552pmid7 a10113/377722hdl  aagid:37772-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL001 0aB2001 aJaramillo, JulianaeauthoruInstitute of Plant Diseases and Plant Protection, University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany10aThermal Tolerance of the Coffee Berry Borer Hypothenemus hampei: Predictions of Climate Change Impact on a Tropical Insect Pest3 aClimate Change & Coffee  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCoffee is predicted to be severely affected by climate change. We determined the thermal tolerance of the coffee berry borer , Hypothenemus hampei , the most devastating pest of coffee worldwide, and make inferences on the possible effects of climate change using climatic data from Colombia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. For this, the effect of eight temperature regimes (15, 20, 23, 25, 27, 30, 33 and 35°C) on the bionomics of H. hampei was studied. Successful egg to adult development occurred between 20–30°C. Using linear regression and a modified Logan model, the lower and upper thresholds for development were estimated at 14.9 and 32°C, respectively. In Kenya and Colombia, the number of pest generations per year was considerably and positively correlated with the warming tolerance. Analysing 32 years of climatic data from Jimma (Ethiopia) revealed that before 1984 it was too cold for H. hampei to complete even one generation per year, but thereafter, because of rising temperatures in the area, 1–2 generations per year/coffee season could be completed. Calculated data on warming tolerance and thermal safety margins of H. hampei for the three East African locations showed considerably high variability compared to the Colombian site. The model indicates that for every 1°C rise in thermal optimum (T opt.), the maximum intrinsic rate of increase (r max) will increase by an average of 8.5%. The effects of climate change on the further range of H. hampei distribution and possible adaption strategies are discussed.

Along with rising temperatures and water shortages, scarcity of inputs such as high energy feeds is predicted. With the motivation of selecting cattle adapted to these changing environments, we conducted a genome wide association study to detect DNA markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms) associated with the sensitivity of milk production to environmental conditions. To do this we combined historical milk production and weather records with dense marker genotypes on dairy sires with many daughters milking across a wide range of production environments in Australia. Markers associated with sensitivity of milk production to feeding level and sensitivity of milk production to temperature humidity index on chromosome nine and twenty nine respectively were validated in two independent populations, one a different breed of cattle. As the extent of linkage disequilibrium across cattle breeds is limited, the underlying causative mutations have been mapped to a small genomic interval containing two promising candidate genes. The validated marker panels we have reported here will aid selection for high milk production under anticipated climate change scenarios, for example selection of sires whose daughters will be most productive at low levels of feeding.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adaughters 3asires 3afeeds 3afeeding level 3aanimal breeders 3alinkage disequilibrium 3adairy cattle 3aglobal warming 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aartificial selection 3agenome-wide association study 3acattle breeds 3agenotype 3adairy farming 3aanimal genetics 3aenergy 3achromosomes 3arelative humidity 3aair temperature 3agenotype-environment interaction 3amilking 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3awater shortages 3aenvironmental factors 3amilk production 3afood production 3aAustralia 0ahumidity 0acattle 0aclimate change1 aBowman, Phil J.eauthoruBiosciences Research Division, Department of Primary Industries Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia1 aChamberlain, Amanda J.eauthoruBiosciences Research Division, Department of Primary Industries Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia1 aSavin, KeitheauthoruBiosciences Research Division, Department of Primary Industries Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia1 avan Tassell, Curt P.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Bovine Functional Genomics Laboratory, Beltsville, Maryland, United States of America1 aSonstegard, Tad S.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Bovine Functional Genomics Laboratory, Beltsville, Maryland, United States of America1 aGoddard, Mike E.eauthoruBiosciences Research Division, Department of Primary Industries Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia1 aAñel, Juan A.eEditoruUniversidade de Vigo, Spain0 tPloS one.g, v. 4, no. 8dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl4277198  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/377793Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00066763Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4277198b1932-6203c4d8e83  fPloS one  aissued2 aPublic Library of Scienceeprovider5DNAL  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aIND442849799ExL  aINDdRHFe2010/01/21  a2016-09-13  a20100122 20100205 00000000bIND RHF 2010/01/21  aPLOS_XML.zip  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:1159 reviewed on 2016-01-05T13:00:02Z  aagid:37779  a2018-05-25  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a428497903844nab a2200637 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004100097024002100138035002600159040001800185072000900203072000900212072000900221072000900230100002300239245010000262300001600362500027600378500002400654520146400678593001802142593002002160650001902180650002902199650001302228650002902241650002202270650001502292650001902307650003102326773011602357787001802473787003302491787003002524787002102554852000902575856011202584856009102696912001202787914004602799914003702845917001102882930003302893935002102926945002502947946001102972949001502983952005102998961001203049974001503061984001503076985010303091986001203194991581637610742620221120184103.0081010e20081015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441118862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.04.0502doi7 a10113/231752hdl  aagid:23175-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aF300 0aL300 0aX3301 aRustad, Lindsey E.14aThe response of terrestrial ecosystems to global climate change: Towards an integrated approach  ap. 222-235.  aIn the special issue: Biochemistry of forested ecosystem / edited by Martin Novak, Melanie Vile and Merritt Turetsky.

Climate change has, and will continue to have, profound effects on the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems. As such, there is a critical need to continue to develop a sound scientific basis for national and international policies regulating carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper reflects on the nature of current global change experiments, and provides recommendations for a unified multidisciplinary approach to future research in this dynamic field. These recommendations include: (1) better integration between experiments and models, and amongst experimental, monitoring, and space-for-time studies; (2) stable and increased support for long-term studies and multi-factor experiments; (3) explicit inclusion of biodiversity, disturbance, and extreme events in experiments and models; (4) consideration of timing vs intensity of global change factors in experiments and models; (5) evaluation of potential thresholds or ecosystem 'tipping points'; and (6) increased support for model-model and model-experiment comparisons. These recommendations, which reflect discussions within the TERACC international network of global change scientists, will facilitate the unraveling of the complex direct and indirect effects of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and their components.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aclimate change 3aanthropogenic activities 3aresearch 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aspecies diversity 3aecosystems 3acarbon dioxide 3aelevated atmospheric gases0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Oct. 15, v.  404, no.  2-3 p.222-235dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl4455  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/231753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.04.0503Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4455b0048-9697c404d2-3e222  fScience of the total environment  aissued  a20090901b20091002c00000000  aIND441118869ExL  aINDdYLPe2009/02/03  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20090901 20091002 00000000bIND YLP 2009/02/03  aUSDA/FS  aagid:23175  a2009-10-03  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a411188604707nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098024002200136024001900158035002800177040001800205100012400223245015200347246005400499506007600553520172000629592002802349593001802377506003702395650001902432650002402451650001902475650002002494650001002514650001702524650001502541650001102556650001602567650001602583650001602599650001202615651001202627651001302639651001002652651001102662651001102673700010502684700019002789700008702979700011503066700011303181700009103294773007303385787003303458787001803491787002403509856008403533912001203617914004003629914001303669916001503682917001103697918004603708935002203754949001503776953001703791961001303808962004503821962004803866974001703914983001503931984001503946991581929280742620221207065231.0150316e20110914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012160142DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00245282doi7 aPMC31733812pmcid7 a219354192pmid  aagid:1216014-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaramillo, JulianaeauthoruInstitute of Plant Diseases and Plant Protection, University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany10aSome Like It Hot: The Influence and Implications of Climate Change on Coffee Berry Borer (Hypothenemus hampei) and Coffee Production in East Africa3 aClimate Change, Coffee and the Coffee Berry Borer  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe negative effects of climate change are already evident for many of the 25 million coffee farmers across the tropics and the 90 billion dollar (US) coffee industry. The coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei), the most important pest of coffee worldwide, has already benefited from the temperature rise in East Africa: increased damage to coffee crops and expansion in its distribution range have been reported. In order to anticipate threats and prioritize management actions for H. hampei we present here, maps on future distributions of H. hampei in coffee producing areas of East Africa. Using the CLIMEX model we relate present-day insect distributions to current climate and then project the fitted climatic envelopes under future scenarios A2A and B2B (for HADCM3 model). In both scenarios, the situation with H. hampei is forecasted to worsen in the current Coffea arabica producing areas of Ethiopia, the Ugandan part of the Lake Victoria and Mt. Elgon regions, Mt. Kenya and the Kenyan side of Mt. Elgon, and most of Rwanda and Burundi. The calculated hypothetical number of generations per year of H. hampei is predicted to increase in all C. arabica -producing areas from five to ten. These outcomes will have serious implications for C. arabica production and livelihoods in East Africa. We suggest that the best way to adapt to a rise of temperatures in coffee plantations could be via the introduction of shade trees in sun grown plantations. The aims of this study are to fill knowledge gaps existing in the coffee industry, and to draft an outline for the development of an adaptation strategy package for climate change on coffee production.

Many factors including climate, crop, soil management practices, and soil type can influence the contribution of agriculture to the global carbon cycle. The objective of this study was to investigate the C sequestration potential of conservation agriculture (CA) (defined by minimal soil disturbance, maintaining permanent soil cover, and crop rotations). This study used micrometeorological methods to measure carbon dioxide (CO₂) flux from several alternative CA practices in Harare, central Zimbabwe. Micrometeorological methods can detect differences in total CO₂ emissions of agricultural management practices; our results show that CA practices produce less CO₂ emissions. Over three years of measurement, the mean and standard error (SE) of CO₂ emissions for the plot with the most consistent CA practices was 0.564 ± 0.0122 g CO₂ m⁻² h⁻¹, significantly less than 0.928 ± 0.00859 g CO₂ m⁻² h⁻¹ for the conventional tillage practice. Overall CA practices of no-till with the use of cover crops produced fewer CO₂ emissions than conventional tillage and fallow.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aagricultural conservation practice 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aconventional tillage 3acover crops 3acrop rotation 3adisturbed soils 3afallow 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ano-tillage 3aZimbabwe 0aConservation agriculture 0acarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 0ano-till 0amicrometeorology 0aclimate change mitigation1 aEash, Neal S.eauthoruDepartment of Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science, University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA), Knoxville, TN, USA1 aHicks, Bruce B.eauthoruDepartment of Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science, University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA), Knoxville, TN, USA1 aOetting, Joel N.eauthoruDepartment of Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science, University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA), Knoxville, TN, USA1 aSauer, Thomas J.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service, Ames, IA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7047-12331 aLambert, Dayton M.eauthoruDepartment of Agricultural Economics, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA1 aThierfelder, ChristianeauthoruInternational Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, Southern Africa Regional Office1 aMuoni, TariraieauthoruSwedish University of Agricultural Sciences Uppsala, Sweden1 aLogan, JoanneeauthoruDepartment of Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science, University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA), Knoxville, TN, USA1 aZahn, James A.eauthoruDuPont Tate & Lyle Bio Products, LLC, Loudon, TN, USA1 aGoddard, John J.eauthoruUniversity of Tennessee Extension-Loudon, Loudon, TN, USA0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2020 May 3, v. 18, no. 3 p.250-265dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4004155x1747-762X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl400415540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2020.17502543Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/69824763Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4004155b1747-762Xc18d3e250  fInternational journal of agricultural sustainability  aBatch:2505  aBatch:2535  aissued2 aTaylor & Francis Groupeprovider5DNAL  aIND6069824769ExL  a2020-09-02  a/data/metadata/incoming/taylorfrancis/tags20_tags20.v018.i03_20200610033552#20416229.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/taylorfrancis/14735903.2020.1750254.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/taylorfrancis/  aUSDA/ARS  aARIS manuscript submission  aARIS Manuscript  aBatch:2535 reviewed on 2020-09-02T15:00:12Z  aagid:6982476  a2020-06-10  a2020-09-0203828nab a2200649 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003100098035002800129040001800157100019500175245011700370300001600487520136500503592002801868593001801896650001701914650001501931650002401946650001701970650001901987650002402006650001402030650001302044650001502057650001402072650001302086650001302099653002502112653002402137653002402161653001902185653003502204653002302239700021502262700016302477773008602640787003302726787001802759787002202777856007702799912001202876914004402888914001102932916001502943917001102958918003102969935002203000949001503022953003303037961001303070962004803083974001703131983001503148984001503163991582453210742620221119044413.0160316e20130408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051560262DNAL7 a10.1139/cjb-2012-03002doi  aagid:5156026-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrewell, Brenda J.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Exotic & Invasive Weeds Research Unit, University of California, Davis, Department of Plant Sciences Mail Stop 4, 1 Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, USA.10aSea change under climate change: case studies in rare plant conservation from the dynamic San Francisco Estuary1  ap. 309-318.  aWe present case studies supporting management of two rare plant species in tidal wetlands of the San Francisco Estuary. We used empirical demographic analyses to identify factors to enhance population establishment and survival of Chloropyron molle subsp. molle (Orobancaceae), an annual hemiparasite, and to compare reintroduced with natural populations. Twelve years after outplanting, the reintroduced population persists but is in decline; impediments to success include the lack of adaptive management response to weed invasions and muted variance in hydrology. Transplantation of Lilaeopsis masonii (Apiaceae), a rhizomatous perennial herb, failed to meet success criteria for mitigation at local project scale, but dispersal and establishment of metapopulation patches indicated persistence at the landscape scale. This species has been found to be genetically indistinct from a widespread congener, and has few threats to persistence so long as suitable habitat is present. These two examples demonstrate the need for integrated conservation management strategies that prioritize habitat connectivity and maintain physical processes to support dispersal in response to sea level rise. For the hemiparasite, assisted colonization may sustain populations threatened by sea level rise, but only if a strong commitment to effective stewardship is realized.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aCordylanthus 3aLilaeopsis 3aadaptive management 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aconservation plants 3aestuaries 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3asea level 3avariance 3awetlands 0aplant reintroduction 0awetland restoration 0aadaptive management 0aclimate change 0aChloropyron molle subsp. molle 0aLilaeopsis masonii1 aEspeland, Erin K.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Northern Plains Agricultural Laboratory Pest Management Research Unit, 1500 North Central Avenue, Sidney, MT 59270, USA.

Arid, semi‐arid and coastal agricultural areas are especially vulnerable to climate change impacts on soil salinity. Inventorying and monitoring climate change impacts on salinity are crucial to evaluate the extent of the problem, to recognize trends and to formulate irrigation and crop management strategies that will maintain the agricultural productivity of these areas. Over the past three decades, Corwin and colleagues at the U.S. Salinity Laboratory (USSL) have developed proximal sensor and remote imagery methodologies for assessing soil salinity at multiple scales. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact climate change has had on selected agricultural areas experiencing weather pattern changes, with a focus on the use of proximal and satellite sensors to assess salinity development. Evidence presented in case studies for Californiaʼs San Joaquin Valley (SJV) and Minnesotaʼs Red River Valley (RRV) demonstrates the utility of these sensor approaches in assessing soil salinity changes due to changes in weather patterns. Agricultural areas are discussed where changes in weather patterns have increased root‐zone soil salinity, particularly in areas with shallow water tables (SJV and RRV), coastal areas with seawater intrusion (e.g., Bangladesh and the Gaza Strip) and water‐scarce areas potentially relying on degraded groundwater as an irrigation source (SJV and Murray‐Darling River Basin). Trends in salinization due to climate change indicate that the infrastructure and protocols to monitor soil salinity from field to regional to national to global scales are needed. HIGHLIGHTS: Climate change will have a negative impact on agriculture, particularly in arid regions. Proximal/remote sensors are useful to assess climate change impact on soil salinity across scales. Salt‐water intrusion, shallow water tables and degraded water reuse will increase soil salinity. Infrastructure and protocols to monitor soil salinity across multiple scales are needed.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aagricultural productivity 3aclimate change 3acrop management 3agroundwater 3ainfrastructure 3airrigation 3arhizosphere 3ariver valleys 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3asatellites 3asoil salinity 3awater reuse 3awatersheds 3aweather 3aBangladesh 3aPalestine0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2021 Mar., v. 72, no. 2 p.842-862dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl51589x1351-07547nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5158940uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.130103Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl51589b1351-0754c72d2e842  fEuropean journal of soil science  aBatch:10115  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6072974859ExL  a2021-07-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13510754_2021_72_2.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13510754_2021_72_2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:7297485  a2021-03-02  a2021-07-0607643nab a2200997 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100011600171245009200287300001800379500001100397520142600408592002801834593001801862596003101880596003101911596003101942596004601973596004602019596004602065596002702111596004402138650000802182650001802190650001902208650001702227650001202244650002502256650001302281650001402294650001502308700004902323700018902372700019602561700008102757700010602838700012002944700012703064700016903191700015603360700013203516700012103648700011403769700010303883700013703986700008804123700012204211700006704333700009104400700007804491700012904569700017404698700009704872700012504969700012905094700014405223700007205367700012405439700011305563700013005676700016005806773012505966787003306091787001806124787002206142856007406164912001206238914004606250914002606296917001106322918004306333935002206376949001506398952001906413953005806432954006206490955003406552961001206586974001706598983001506615984001506630991582782740742620221119013904.0220802e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078602662DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.162782doi  aagid:7860266-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Marco, AlessandraeauthoruENEA, CR Casaccia, SSPT‐PVS, Rome, Italy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7200-225710aStrategic roadmap to assess forest vulnerability under air pollution and climate change  ap. 5062-5085.  aREVIEW  aAlthough it is an integral part of global change, most of the research addressing the effects of climate change on forests have overlooked the role of environmental pollution. Similarly, most studies investigating the effects of air pollutants on forests have generally neglected the impacts of climate change. We review the current knowledge on combined air pollution and climate change effects on global forest ecosystems and identify several key research priorities as a roadmap for the future. Specifically, we recommend (1) the establishment of much denser array of monitoring sites, particularly in the South Hemisphere; (2) further integration of ground and satellite monitoring; (3) generation of flux‐based standards and critical levels taking into account the sensitivity of dominant forest tree species; (4) long‐term monitoring of N, S, P cycles and base cations deposition together at global scale; (5) intensification of experimental studies, addressing the combined effects of different abiotic factors on forests by assuring a better representation of taxonomic and functional diversity across the ~73,000 tree species on Earth; (6) more experimental focus on phenomics and genomics; (7) improved knowledge on key processes regulating the dynamics of radionuclides in forest systems; and (8) development of models integrating air pollution and climate change data from long‐term monitoring programs.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a276671cAcademy of Finland  a311929cAcademy of Finland  a316182cAcademy of Finland  aLIFE15 ENV/IT/000183cEuropean Commission  aLIFE19 ENV/FR/000086cEuropean Commission  aLIFE20 GIE/IT/000091cEuropean Commission  aJPMJSC16HBcJST SICORP  aDE‐EM0005228cUS Department of Energy 3aair 3aair pollution 3aclimate change 3aforest trees 3aforests 3afunctional diversity 3agenomics 3aphenomics 3asatellites1 aSicard, PierreeauthoruARGANS, Biot, France1 aFeng, ZhaozhongeauthoruKey Laboratory of Agro‐Meteorology of Jiangsu Province, School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, China1 aAgathokleous, EvgenioseauthoruKey Laboratory of Agro‐Meteorology of Jiangsu Province, School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, China1 aAlonso, RocioeauthoruEcotoxicology of Air Pollution, CIEMAT, Madrid, Spain1 aAraminiene, ValdaeauthoruLithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry, Kaunas, Lithuania1 aAugustatis, AlgirdaseauthoruFaculty of Forest Sciences and Ecology, Vytautas Magnus University, Kaunas, Lithuania1 aBadea, Ovidiueauthoru“Marin Drăcea” National Institute for Research and Development in Forestry, Voluntari, Romania1 aBeasley, James C.eauthoruSavannah River Ecology Laboratory and Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, University of Georgia, Aiken, South Carolina, USA1 aBranquinho, CristinaeauthoruCentre for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Changes, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal1 aBruckman, Viktor J.eauthoruCommission for Interdisciplinary Ecological Studies, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria1 aCollalti, AlessioeauthoruForest Modeling Lab., ISAFOM‐CNR, Perugia, Italy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4980-84871 aDavid‐Schwartz, RakefeteauthoruInstitute of Plant Sciences, ARO—Volcani Center, Rishon LeTsiyon, Israel1 aDomingos, MarisaeauthoruInstituto de Botanica, Nucleo de Pesquisa em Ecologia, Sao Paulo, Brazil1 aDu, EnzaieauthoruFaculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5519-01501 aGarcia Gomez, HectoreauthoruEcotoxicology of Air Pollution, CIEMAT, Madrid, Spain1 aHashimoto, ShojieauthoruDepartment of Forest Soils, Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, Tsukuba, Japan1 aHoshika, YasutomoeauthoruIRET‐CNR, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy1 aJakovljevic, TamaraeauthoruCroatian Forest Research Institute, Jastrebarsko, Croatia1 aMcNulty, SteveneauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Research Triangle Park, USA1 aOksanen, ElinaeauthoruDepartment of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland1 aOmidi Khaniabadi, YusefeauthoruDepartment of Environmental Health Engineering, Industrial Medial and Health, Petroleum Industry Health Organization (PIHO), Ahvaz, Iran1 aPrescher, Anne‐KatrineauthoruThuenen Institute of Forest Ecosystems, Eberswalde, Germany1 aSaitanis, Costas J.eauthoruLab of Ecology and Environmental Science, Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, Greece1 aSase, HiroyukieauthoruEcological Impact Research Department, Asia Center for Air Pollution Research (ACAP), Niigata, Japan1 aSchmitz, AndreaseauthoruState Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection of North Rhine‐Westphalia, Recklinghausen, Germany1 aVoigt, Gabrieleeauthorur.e.m.

A rise in ambient temperature and carbon dioxide (CO₂) may have various impacts on arthropods such as altered life cycles, modified reproductive patterns, and changes in distribution. The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is a global pest responsible for significant losses of agricultural yields annually. This study was conducted to determine the impacts of changing temperature and CO₂ levels on selected life history parameters of B. tabaci biotype B. Populations were established at three temperature regimes (25,28, and 33°C), and each population was evaluated in all three environments. Collard, Brassica oleracea ssp. acephala de Condolle (Brassicaceae), was used as the host. These results were based on data from 5 to ≈30 generations. Oviposition, nymphal survival, and reproduction were significantly affected by temperature, with net reproductive success declining to 36.4% at 33°C. Overall, 28°C was most favorable for whitefly fitness. However, the optimal temperature for B. tabaci reproduction may be between 28 and 33°C. There were no temperature effects on total nonstructural carbohydrate concentrations in collard, and impacts of the host plant on whitefly development in the different environments were determined to be minimal. An environment of enriched CO₂ (750 ppm) was not observed to have an adverse effect on whitefly reproduction. Temperature was negatively correlated with adult body size. Length and width of males and females were affected by temperature. Data regarding population dynamics of B. tabaci in response to climate change are important for accurate predictions and improving management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3alife history 3aoviposition 3aarthropods 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3apopulation dynamics 3aadults 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrelation 3amales 3aambient temperature 3ayields 3afemales 3aBemisia tabaci 3ahost plants 3aclimate change 3apests 3aBrassica oleracea 3aadverse effects 3aprediction 3abody size 3apopulation 0atemperature 0aHemiptera1 aSimmons, Alvin M.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, U.S. Vegetable Laboratory, 2700 Savannah Highway, Charleston, SC 29414.1 aAbd-Rabou, ShaabaneauthoruMinistry of Agriculture, ARC, Plant Protection Research Institute, 7 Nadi El-Seid, Dokki, Giza, Egypt.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2014, v. 107, no. 5 p.933-943dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 o(Journal)jnl44731  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44731b0013-8746c107d5e933  fAnnals of the Entomological Society of America  aBatch:1194  aissued2 aBioOneeprovider5DNAL  aIND6012689979ExL  a2016-02-09  aESAAv107i5-08290259-410747.zip  aUSDA/ARS  aNo DOI  aBatch:1194 reviewed on 2016-02-09T14:00:02Z  aagid:1268997  a2015-11-24  a2016-02-0903624nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002100097035002600118040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180100001600189245008500205300001600290500002400306500001500330520163300345593001801978650001101996650001602007650003102023650001502054650001602069650002402085650001902109650001102128651001702139651001002156653001802166653001802184653001802202653001902220700001302239700001502252700001402267700001602281773007002297787001802367787003002385787003302415852000902448856011202457912001202569914003002581917001102611930003302622935002102655945002502676946001302701949001502714952005102729961001302780974001502793984001502808985010302823986001202926991583064800742620221119033553.0080219e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440167602DNAL7 a10113/107432hdl  aagid:10743-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aB200 0aX1001 aZhang, G.H.10aPotential Effects of Climate Change on Runoff in the Yellow River Basin of China  ap. 911-918.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aWater scarcity is one of the most challenging issues in arid and semi-arid regions. In the Yellow River basin, rapid growth of population, urbanization, and industrialization have caused ever-increasing competition for water. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on mean annual runoff in the Yellow River basin under different climate change scenarios projected by the Hadley Centre's third-generation general circulation model (HadCM3) using an evaporation ratio function of the aridity index. The results showed that annual runoff was more sensitive to change in precipitation than to change in evaporation. Simulations using HadCM3 scenarios A2 and B2 indicated that the changes in annual runoff compared to 30-year average runoff for each region, which varied from region to region, ranged from -34.1% to 49.6%. In general, the potential changes in annual runoff were greater in the middle and down reaches of the Yellow River basin. For the Yellow River basin as a whole, the mean annual runoff increased up to 2.2%, 12.3%, and 11.4% for scenario A2, and the changes were 8.4%, -0.1%, and 5.3% for scenario B2 by the years 2020, 2050, and 2080, respectively. However, the increase in future annual runoff will be insufficient to meet projected water demands of the Yellow River Basin. Proper water management and water conservation technologies will need to be considered for the coming century to avoid water shortages. The expected increases in runoff require that more attention will be given to soil and water conservation practices such as vegetation and check-dam construction.  aPubAg article 3arivers 3astream flow 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3awatersheds 3aevaporation 3awatershed hydrology 3aglobal warming 3arunoff 3aYellow River 3aChina 0aannual runoff 0aprecipitation 0aaridity index 0aclimate change1 aFu, S.H.1 aFang, W.H.1 aImura, H.1 aZhang, X.C.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2007 , v.  50, no.  3 p.911-9187nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/107433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  fTransactions of the ASABE  aissued  a20080423b20080502c00000000  aIND440167609ExL  aINDdRHFe2008/03/05  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20080423 20080502 00000000bIND RHF 2008/03/05  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:10743  a2010-02-13  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a401676003908nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002100097035002600118040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189072000900198100001500207245011300222300001600335500005600351500002400407520169100431593001802122594002202140650001102162650002002173650001102193650001902204650002402223650001902247650002702266650002202293650002702315650002202342650001402364651001502378651001202393651001502405651001002420651001302430651001602443653001702459700001302476700001902489700001602508773007602524787001802600787003302618852000902651856011202660912001202772914005102784917001102835930003302846935002102879945002502900946001302925949001502938952005102953961001303004974001503017984001503032985010303047986001203150991583408880742620221119053117.0080317s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND440289312DNAL7 a10113/119882hdl  aagid:11988-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aE200 0aB200 0aF300 0aX1001 aHima, B.L.13aAn economic analysis of climate change on cotton production across the U.S. cotton belt: preliminary results  ap. 608-612.  aConference held January 5-9, 2004, San Antonio, TX.  aIncludes references  aIncreases in average ambient temperature and CO2 levels, as predicted by researchers studying climate change, may potentially affect agricultural production levels and the suitability of regions for specific crop production. The crop simulation model, GOSSYM, was used to examine the impact of changes in these two variables on yield and irrigation requirements of cotton produced at nine locations across the U.S. cotton belt: Shafter, CA; Maricopa, AZ; Artesia, NM; Lubbock TX, Corpus Christi, TX; Portageville, MO; Stoneville, MS, Meridianville, AL, and Florence SC. Average net returns were calculated for each location, under two potential climate regimes, one based on historic weather patterns and one based on patterns predicted by a regional climate model (Mearns, 2000). Under each regime, the interaction of five changes in average temperature and five changes in carbon dioxide level were evaluated. The ranges chosen for changes in temperature and CO2 levels reflect conditions from the pre-industrial era to the limit of accepted scientific predictions for climate change. While results were specific for each location, some general trends are that, ceteris paribus, as CO2 level increased, production improved and net returns increased. However, yield and net returns results under the regional climate model's predictions of future climate generally had lower magnitude yield and net returns than those under present climate at all levels of atmospheric CO2 and temperature deviation. Thus future climate conditions had a negative effect on yield and net returns at most locations. No clear trend emerged on the effects of temperature increases on yield and net returns.  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article 3acotton 3acrop production 3ayields 3aclimate change 3aambient temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3airrigation requirement 3asimulation models 3ageographical variation 3acosts and returns 3aequations 3aCalifornia 3aArizona 3aNew Mexico 3aTexas 3aMissouri 3aMississippi 0aGOSSYM model1 aLu, Y.C.1 aRichardson, A.1 aReddy, K.R.0 tProceedings of the Beltwide Cotton Conferences.g2004,  p.608-6127nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/119883Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  fProceedings of the Beltwide Cotton Conferences  aissued  a20080324b20080404c00000000  aIND440289319ExL  aINDdLYNe2008/03/24  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20080324 20080404 00000000bIND LYN 2008/03/24  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:11988  a2008-04-04  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a402893103143nab a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075035002800098040001800126100009600144245014600240300001600386520102900402592002801431650002001459650001101479650001901490650001201509650001901521650001201540650002201552650002301574650001601597650001101613650002101624651001901645653002301664653002601687653001901713653001601732653002601748700010401774700010001878773018301978787003302161787001802194912001202212914003902224914003702263916001502300917001102315918002702326935002202353949001502375953003302390961001202423962001102435962004802446974001702494983001502511984001502526991583427150742620221119054814.0151124e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012839912DNAL  aagid:1283991-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, WueauthoruNicholas School of the Environment, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA10aApplication of a Full Hierarchical Bayesian Model in Assessing Streamflow Response to a Climate Change Scenario at the Coweeta Basin, NC, USA  ap. 118-128.  aWe have applied a full hierarchical Baysian (HB) model to simulate streamflow at the Coweeta Basin that drains western North Carolina, USA under a doubled CO₂ climate scenario. The full HB model coherently assimilated multiple data sources and accounted for uncertainties from data, parameters and model structures. Full predictive distributions for streamflow from the Bayesian analysis indicate not only increasing drought, with substantial decrease in fall and summer flows, and soil moisture content, but also increase in the frequency of flood events when they were fit with Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) under this doubled CO₂ climate scenario compared to the current climate scenario. Full predictive distributions based on the hierarchical Bayesian model, compared to deterministic point estimates, is capable of providing richer information to facilitate development of adaptation strategy to changing climate for a sustainable water resource management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3abasins 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3asimulation models 3asoil water content 3astream flow 3asummer 3awater management 3aNorth Carolina 0ahierarchical Bayes 0ahydrological modeling 0aclimate change 0auncertainty 0ahydrological extremes1 aClark, James S.eauthoruNicholas School of the Environment, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA1 aVose, James M.eauthoruUSDA-Forest Service, Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, Otto, NC 28763, USA0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2012 June, v. 3, no. 2 p.118-128dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1674-764X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 o(Journal)2202  aArticle  aJournal:2202b1674-764Xc3d2e118  fJournal of resources and ecology  aBatch:1152  aissued2 aBioOneeprovider5DNAL  aIND6012839919ExL  a2016-01-04  aJOREv3i2-07190812-230431.zip  aUSDA/FS  aNo DOI  aBatch:1152 reviewed on 2016-01-04T14:00:02Z  aagid:1283991  a2015-11-24  a2016-01-0404230nab a2200817 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002100115024003000136024001100166035002600177040001800203100002300221245006400244300001600308500001500324506017300339520137300512593001801885593002001903593002001923650001901943650001601962650002201978650002602000650003102026650002902057650001602086650001302102650001002115650002502125650001902150650002202169650001602191650001602207650001002223653002402233700002202257700002702279700002502306700002802331700002502359700002502384700002802409700002702437700002602464773008702490787003302577787001802610787003002628787001902658856011202677856004302789912001202832914003702844914002602881917001102907935002202918949001502940956013302955961000903088962003003097962004803127962004703175962004703222974001503269985011703284986001103401991583430330742620221214225847.0130624e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006801852DNAL7 a2870372aris7 a10113/569032hdl7 a10.1038/NCLIMATE19162doi8 ans2237  aagid:56903-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsseng, S.eauthor10aUncertainty in simulating wheat yields under climate change  ap. 827-832.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aProjections of climate change impacts on crop yields are inherently uncertain1. Uncertainty is often quantified when projecting future greenhouse gas emissions and their influence on climate2. However, multi-model uncertainty analysis of crop responses to climate change is rare because systematic and objective comparisons among process-based crop simulation models1, 3 are difficult4. Here we present the largest standardized model intercomparison for climate change impacts so far. We found that individual crop models are able to simulate measured wheat grain yields accurately under a range of environments, particularly if the input information is sufficient. However, simulated climate change impacts vary across models owing to differences in model structures and parameter values. A greater proportion of the uncertainty in climate change impact projections was due to variations among crop models than to variations among downscaled general circulation models. Uncertainties in simulated impacts increased with CO2 concentrations and associated warming. These impact uncertainties can be reduced by improving temperature and CO2 relationships in models and better quantified through use of multi-model ensembles. Less uncertainty in describing how climate change may affect agricultural productivity will aid adaptation strategy development and policymaking.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  eARIS manuscript 3acarbon dioxide 3acrop models 3asimulation models 3aquantitative analysis 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3auncertainty 3avariance 3awheat 3auncertainty analysis 3aglobal warming 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3atemperature 3acrops 0amathematical models1 aEwert, F.eauthor1 aRosenzweig, C.eauthor1 aJones, J.

Many of these investments will seek to modify how land is managed. The return on both types of investments can be increased through an understanding of land potential: the potential of the land to support primary production and ecosystem services, and its resilience. A Land‐Potential Knowledge System (LandPKS) is being developed and implemented to provide individual users with point‐based estimates of land potential based on the integration of simple, geo‐tagged user inputs with cloud‐based information and knowledge. This system will rely on mobile phones for knowledge and information exchange, and use cloud computing to integrate, interpret, and access relevant knowledge and information, including local knowledge about land with similar potential. The system will initially provide management options based on long‐term land potential, which depends on climate, topography, and relatively static soil properties, such as soil texture, depth, and mineralogy. Future modules will provide more specific management information based on the status of relatively dynamic soil properties such as organic matter and nutrient content, and of weather. The paper includes a discussion of how this system can be used to help distinguish between meteorological and edaphic drought.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article  a808bjgilbertc2016-05-24dfedoraAdmine2016-05-24  cDutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs  cAfrica Soil Information Service (AfSIS)  cBill and Melinda Gates foundation  cAlliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA)  eARIS manuscript 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental health 3ainformation exchange 3aknowledge 3amanagement information systems 3amineralogy 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3aprimary productivity 3asoil properties 3atopography 0aagriculture 0aanalytics 0acrowdsourcing 0aexpert systems 0aextension 0aknowledge management 0aland evaluation 0aland‐use planning 0amobile apps 0asustainability 0asustainable land management1 aBeh, AdameauthoruU.S. Department of Agriculture ‐ Agricultural Research Service, New Mexico State University, Jornada Experimental Range MSC 3JER Box 30003 Las Cruces, New Mexico,  88003‐8003USA1 aBarrios, EdmundoeauthoruWorld Agroforestry Centre, United Nations Avenue, Gigiri P.O.

In fact, their relative importance can be assessed by tracking past population fluctuations over considerable time periods. We applied the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent approach on the genomes of 11 temperate Juglans species to estimate trajectories of changes in effective population size (Nₑ) and used a Bayesian‐coalescent based approach that simultaneously considers multiple genomes (G‐PhoCS) to estimate divergence times between lineages. Nₑ curves of all study species converged 1.0 million yr ago, probably reflecting the time when the walnut genus last shared a common ancestor. This estimate was confirmed by the G‐PhoCS estimates of divergence times. But all species did not react similarly to the dramatic climatic oscillations following early Pleistocene cooling, so the timing and amplitude of changes in Nₑ differed among species and even among conspecific lineages. The population histories of temperate walnut species were not driven by extrinsic environmental changes alone, and a key role was probably played by species‐specific factors such as coevolutionary interactions with specialized pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aJuglans 3aantagonists 3aclimate change 3acoevolution 3acooling 3ademography 3aeffective population size 3agenome 3apathogens 3apopulation dynamics 3awalnuts1 aYan, Peng‐ChengeauthoruState Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology and Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China1 aZhang, Bo‐WeneauthoruState Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology and Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China1 aWoeste, Keith E.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service Hardwood Tree Improvement and Regeneration Center (HTIRC), Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, USA1 aLin, KuieauthoruState Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology and Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China1 aZhang, Da‐YongeauthoruState Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology and Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China0 tnew phytologist.g2018 Mar., v. 217, no. 4 p.1726-1736dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4466540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.149173Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44665b0028-646Xc217d4e1726  fnew phytologist  aBatch:1974  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058921859ExL  a2018-06-19  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/0028646X_2018_217_4.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/0028646X_2018_217_4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:5892185  a2018-06-19  a2018-06-1904661nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100014200171245007600313300001800389500001900407500002000426520204600446592002802492593001802520596006802538650001102606650001702617650001202634650001902646650001402665650001202679650002202691650001202713650001402725650002302739650000902762650001902771650001902790650001002809650001402819651001502833700015002848700016102998700014203159773012403301787003303425787001803458787002203476856007303498912001203571914004603583914002603629916001603655917001103671918004303682935002203725949001503747953005803762954006203820955003403882961001203916974001703928983001503945984001503960991583515340742620221119004747.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071442482DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.153182doi  aagid:7144248-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodwin, Marissa J.eauthoruDepartment of Biology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8670-660X10aChanging climate reallocates the carbon debt of frequent‐fire forests  ap. 6180-6189.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOngoing climate change will alter the carbon carrying capacity of forests as they adjust to climatic extremes and changing disturbance regimes. In frequent‐fire forests, increasing drought frequency and severity are already causing widespread tree mortality events, which can exacerbate the carbon debt that has developed as a result of fire exclusion. Forest management techniques that reduce tree density and surface fuels decrease the risk of high‐severity wildfire and may also limit drought‐induced mortality by reducing competition. We used a long‐term thinning and burning experiment in a mixed‐conifer forest to investigate the effects of the 2012–2015 California drought on forest carbon dynamics in each treatment, including the carbon emissions from a second‐entry prescribed fire that followed the drought. We assessed differences in carbon stability and tree survival across treatments, expecting that both carbon stability and survival probability would increase with increasing treatment intensity (decreasing basal area). Additionally, we analyzed the effects of drought‐ mortality on second‐entry burn emissions and compared emissions for the first‐ and second‐entry burns. We found a non‐linear relationship between treatment intensity and carbon stability, which was in part driven by varying relationships between individual tree growing space and survival across treatments. Drought mortality increased dead tree and surface fuel carbon in all treatments, which contributed to higher second‐entry burn emissions for two of the three burn treatments when compared to the first burn. Our findings suggest that restoration treatments will not serve as a panacea for ongoing climate change and that the carbon debt of these forests will become increasingly unstable as the carbon carrying capacity adjusts to severe drought events. Managing the carbon debt with prescribed fire will help reduce the risk of additional mortality from wildfire, but at an increasing carbon cost for forest management.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a8GG14803cCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adead wood 3adrought 3aforest management 3aforests 3amortality 3aprescribed burning 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3atree mortality 3atrees 3awildfires 3aCalifornia1 aNorth, Malcolm P.eauthoruPacific Southwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Mammoth Lakes, CA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9090-784X1 aZald, Harold S.

The hydrology, productivity, and ecosystem services from freshwater wetlands depend on their future water balance. We simulated the hydrology and vegetation dynamics of wetland complexes in the North American Prairie Pothole Region with the WETLANDSCAPE model. Simulations for 63 precipitation × temperature combinations spanning 6°C warming and −20% to +20% annual precipitation change at 19 locations along a mid-continental aridity gradient showed that aridity explained up to 99% of the variation in wetland stage and hydroperiod for all wetland permanence types, and in vegetation cycling for semipermanent wetlands. The magnitude and direction of hydrologic responses depended on whether climate changes increased or decreased water deficits. Warming to 6°C and 20% less precipitation increased wetland water deficits and more strongly decreased wetland stage and hydroperiod from historic levels at low aridity, especially in semipermanent wetlands, where peak vegetation cycling (Cover Cycle Index, CCI) also shifted to lower aridity. In contrast, 20% more precipitation decreased water deficits, increasing wetland stage and hydroperiod most strongly in shallow wetlands at high aridity, but filling semipermanent wetlands and reducing CCI at low aridity. All climate changes narrowed the range of aridity favorable to high productivity. Climate changes that reduce water deficits may help maintain wetlands at high aridity at the expense of those at low aridity, but with warming certain, increased deficits are more likely and will help maintain wetlands at lower aridity but exacerbate loss of wetlands at high aridity. Thus, there is likely not a universally applicable approach to mitigating climate change impacts on freshwater wetlands across regional aridity gradients. Conservation strategies need to account for aridity-specific effects of climate change on freshwater wetland ecosystems.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  bllucasc2017-08-04dmanager-lgarnere2017-08-07  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSGSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000203  eARIS manuscript 3awetlands 3afreshwater 3aecosystem services 3adry environmental conditions 3aair temperature 3amodels 3avegetation cover 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aPrairie Pothole region 0awater balance1 aGuntenspergen, Glenn R.eauthoruUSGS, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Laurel, Maryland, USA1 aOlker, Jennifer H.eauthoruNatural Resources Research Institute, University of Minnesota Duluth, 5013 Miller Trunk Highway, Duluth, Minnesota 55811 USA1 aJohnson, W.

These proxies have proven useful for understanding the soil C cycle, which is highly variable in both space and time, and are now being used to make predictions of the fate and persistence of C under future climate scenarios. However, the C pools and processes that proxies represent must be thoughtfully considered in order to minimize uncertainties in empirical understanding. This is necessary to capture the full value of a proxy in model parameters and in model outcomes. Here, we provide specific examples of proxy variables that could improve decision‐making, and modeling skill, while also encouraging continued work on their mechanistic underpinnings. We explore the use of three common soil proxies used to study soil C cycling: metabolic quotient, clay content, and physical fractionation. We also consider how emerging data types, such as genome‐sequence data, can serve as proxies for microbial community activities. By examining some broad assumptions in soil C cycling with the proxies already in use, we can develop new hypotheses and specify criteria for new and needed proxies.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acarbon sinks 3aclay fraction 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3afractionation 3amicrobial communities 3amodels 3aprediction 3aspace and time 3auncertainty1 aBond‐Lamberty, BeneauthoruPacific Northwest National Laboratory, Joint Global Change Research Institute, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA1 aDeAngelis, KristeneauthoruDepartment of Microbiology, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA1 aGrandy, A.

Projecting the spatial distribution and impacts of these risks requires consideration of biophysical and socioeconomic factors. Models like the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) can project spatial distributions of hydrologic risk due to shifting biophysical factors like climate and land use, but cannot account for socioeconomic factors influencing a community’s capacity to adapt to future streamflow changes. To address this limitation, we used a risk matrix to classify subbasins in a large river basin in the southeastern USA based on (1) percent increase in SWAT simulated 10-year and extreme high flows due to climate and land use change between baseline (1982–2002) and projected (2050–2070) periods and (2) degree of community vulnerability according to a Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). We compared spatial distributions of high-risk subbasins based on SWAT results, SVI results, and the integration of SWAT and SVI results using a risk matrix. Large increases in simulated 10-year and extreme high flows occurred in middle and lower parts of the river basin, and socially vulnerable communities were distributed throughout. We identified 16, 7, and 14 unique high-risk subbasins using SWAT results, SVI results, and SWAT and SVI results, respectively. By using a risk matrix, we identified subbasins with vulnerable communities that are projected to experience future increases in streamflow due to climate and land use change. These results serve as a starting point for subsequent climate change adaptation planning.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aDE-SC0014664cOak Ridge Institute for Science and Education 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahuman communities 3aland use change 3aplanning 3arisk 3arisk management 3asocioeconomic factors 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aSoutheastern United States1 aSuttles, Kelly M.eauthoruCenter for Housing and Community Studies, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, North Carolina, USA1 aCutts, Bethany B.eauthoruDepartment of Tourism, Parks and Management, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA1 aEmanuel, Ryan E.eauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Environmental Resources, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA1 aMartin, Katherine L.eauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Environmental Resources, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA1 aWear, David N.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Southern Research Station, 3041 East Cornwallis Road, Durham, North Carolina, 27709, USA1 aCoulston, John W.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Southern Research Station, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA1 aVose, James M.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Southern Research Station, 3041 East Cornwallis Road, Durham, North Carolina, 27709, USA0 tEcosystems.g2020 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.67-83dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl7003840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-019-00387-53Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl70038b1432-9840c23d1e67  fEcosystems  aBatch:2472  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6068250409ExL  a2020-06-02  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_20-01-28_06-11-41.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10021-23-1.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2472 reviewed on 2020-06-02T08:57:35Z  aagid:6825040  a2020-01-28  a2020-06-0205822nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100012300182245012100305520231200426592002802738593001802766650001702784650001102801650001702812650002402829650003002853650001202883650001902895650001902914650002202933650001302955650002102968650002202989650001503011650001403026651001503040653002003055653003003075653003903105653003003144653002603174700015903200700010703359700011203466700018203578700018003760700014303940700012004083700013104203773011604334787003304450787001804483787002104501856008504522912001204607914004404619914003404663916001604697917001104713918003604724935002204760949001504782952001904797953009304816954006104909955003504970961001205005974001705017983001505034984001505049991583849260742620221119032021.0220124e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075651592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1197942doi  aagid:7565159-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaines, William L.eauthoruWashington Conservation Science Institute, 12725 Wilson Street, Leavenworth, WA 98826, USA10aClimate change and forest management on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest, USA: Managing for dynamic landscapes  aThe 1994 Northwest Forest Plan signified a watershed moment for natural resource management on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest. It established clear priorities for ecologically motivated management of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity conservation on nearly 10 million hectares of public lands in Oregon, Washington, and northern California. Conservation reserves were the primary means of safeguarding remaining old forest and riparian habitats, and the populations of northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, and Pacific salmon that depend on them. As envisioned, reserves would provide habitat for the protected species during a lengthy recovery period. However, reserve strategies were grounded on two tacit assumptions: the climate is stable, and there are limited disruptions by invasive species; neither of which has turned out to be true. Managing for northern spotted owls and other late-successional and old forest associated species within the context of static reserves has turned out to be incredibly challenging. As climatic and wildfire regimes continually shift and rapidly reshape landscapes and habitats, conservation efforts that rely solely on maintaining static conditions within reserves are likely to fail, especially in seasonally dry forests. Forest planners and managers are now occupied with efforts to amend or revise Forest Plans within the NWFP area. According to the 2012 Planning Rule, their charge is to focus management on restoring ecosystem integrity and resiliency and address impacts of climate change and invasive species. Here, we integrate information from ecological and climate sciences, species recovery planning, and forest plan monitoring to identify management adaptations that can help managers realize the original Plan goals as integrated with the goals of the 2012 Planning Rule. There are no guarantees associated with any future planning scenario; continual learning and adaptation are necessary. Our recommendations include managing for dynamic rather than static conditions in seasonally dry forests, managing dynamically shifting reserves in wetter forests, where dynamics occur more slowly, reducing stressors in aquatic and riparian habitats, and significantly increased use of adaptive management and collaborative planning.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aOncorhynchus 3aOregon 3aStrigiformes 3aadaptive management 3abiodiversity conservation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aforest ecology 3aforest management 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3aprotected species 3awatersheds 3awildfires 3aCalifornia 0aStatic reserves 0aSpecies recovery planning 0aEcosystem integrity and resiliency 0aClimate change adaptation 0aEcosystem restoration1 aHessburg, Paul F.eauthoruPNW Research Station, USDA-Forest Service, 1133 N.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers codified a new “waters of the United States” rule on June 29, 2015, because several Supreme Court case decisions caused confusion with the existing rule. Climate change could affect this rule through connectivity between groundwater and surface waters; floodplain waters and the 100-year floodplain; changes in jurisdictional status; and sea level rise on coastal ecosystems. Four approaches are discussed for handling these implications: (1) “Wait and see”; (2) changes to the rule; (3) use guidance documents; (4) Congress statutorily defining “waters of the United States.” The approach chosen should be legally defensible and achieved in a timely fashion to provide protection to “waters of the United States” in proactive consideration of scientifically documented effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aClean Water Act 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aclimate change 3acourts 3afloodplains 3agroundwater 3asea level 3asurface water 3aUnited States1 aMoore, Matthew T.eauthor1 aEmison, Gerald Andrewseauthor1 aRush, Scott A.eauthor0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 May, v. 96, no. 5 p.565-572dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4614540uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/51842543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-016-1773-z3Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46145b0007-4861c96d5e565  fBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology  aBatch:1308  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6051842549ExL  a2019-06-18  aftp_PUB_16-04-17_05-10-11.zip  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Faust%20et%20al%202016%20BECT%20565-572.pdf  aUSDA  aJournal title changed from 'Bull Environ Contam Toxicol'  aBatch:1308 reviewed on 2016-06-15T13:00:03Z  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aagid:5184254  a2016-04-17  a2019-06-18  ans1419605012nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003700098035002800135040001800163100012600181245009200307300001600399520200100415592002802416593001802444650003102462650002302493650003402516650003002550650001202580650001902592650001602611650001102627650001502638650001902653650001002672650001602682650002202698650002002720651001002740653001902750653000902769653001702778653002702795653002202822700012302844700012402967700011803091700010903209700012603318700012203444773013103566787003303697787001803730787002103748856008403769912001203853914003103865914003403896916001503930917001103945918003603956935002203992949001504014953009304029954006104122955003504183961001304218974001704231983001504248984001504263991584003190742620221119041408.0190719e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064619662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2019.05.0302doi  aagid:6461966-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, XiaopingeauthoruXinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xinjiang, 830011, China10aSimulating impacts of climate change on cotton yield and water requirement using RZWQM2  ap. 231-241.  aAssessing the potential impacts of climate change on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yield and water demand is crucial in allocating water resources. In this study, cotton yield and water requirement under future climate scenarios was evaluated in Qira oasis, China. Six general circulation models (GCMs), under moderate and high representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (4.5 and 8.5) and elevated CO2 (eCO2) concentration (218–502ppm), were used to project climate for near (2041–2060) and far future (2061–2080) periods. With current management practices, the impacts of climate change on cotton yield and water requirement were simulated using the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2), which was calibrated with experimental data (2007–2014) in a previous study. For the study region, the GCMs predicted an increase of 2.38°C and 3.24°C in temperature and 3.5% and 5.3% mm in precipitation during the growing seasons (April–October) for 2041–2060 and 2061–2080, respectively. For 2041–2060, seed cotton yield was projected to increase by 0.24Mg ha−1 (5.6%) under RCP4.5 and 0.19Mg ha−1 (4.5%) under RCP8.5 comparing to the baseline yield of 4.23Mg ha-1; however, for 2061–2080, the model predicted a 0.32Mg ha−1 (7.6%) yield increase under RCP4.5 but a 0.28Mg ha−1 (6.5%) decrease under RCP8.5. The increased cotton yield was mainly attributable to the fertilization effect of eCO2 dominating the detrimental effects of shorter growing seasons (8.0–9.5 days). Alleviated low temperature stress also slightly promoted cotton yield. Averaged across the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, simulated cropping season water requirement for the 2041–2060 and 2061–2080 were 728mm and 706mm, respectively, an decrease by 7.5% and 10.3% relative to the present day baseline (786mm), respectively. This decrease was attributed to shorter growing seasons and eCO2. These results suggest that the region's agricultural water crisis may be alleviated in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aRoot Zone Water Quality Model 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acold stress 3acotton 3acrop yield 3agrowing season 3aoases 3atemperature 3awater requirement 3awater resources 3aChina 0aClimate change 0aGCMs 0aRZWQM2 model 0aCrop water requirement 0aSeed cotton yield1 aQi, ZhimingeauthoruXinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xinjiang, 830011, China1 aGui, DongweieauthoruXinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xinjiang, 830011, China1 aGu, ZheeauthoruCollege of Agricultural Engineering, Hohai University, No. 1 Xikang Road, Nanjing, 210098, China1 aMa, LiwangeauthoruUSDA-ARS Rangeland Resources and Systems Research Unit, Fort Collins, CO, 80526, USA1 aZeng, FanjiangeauthoruXinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xinjiang, 830011, China1 aLi, LanhaieauthoruXinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xinjiang, 830011, China0 tAgricultural water management.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 222 p.231-241dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:2257  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6064619669ExL  a2019-07-19  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/906251995332688479-00001-HEAD-ONLY-REVISEDSUBJECTLIST.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0378377419305669.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6461966  a2019-07-19  a2019-07-1903550nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001900098024003500117035002800152040001800180100011500198245019000313300001600503520091100519592002801430593001801458650001901476650002301495650002001518650001001538650001501548650002901563650002101592650001401613650002501627650001101652650002201663653001501685653001601700653001501716653001401731700016001745700012601905700013902031773011202170787003302282787001802315787002402333856008102357912001202438914004602450914001102496916001502507917001102522918004702533935002202580949001502602953006102617954006402678955003802742961001302780962004802793974001702841983001502858984001502873991584272250742620221119004526.0190804e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065572022DNAL7 a237394782pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311130007482doi  aagid:6557202-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel Prado, A.eauthoruBasque Centre for Climate Change (BC3), Alameda Urquijo, 4, 4°-1a /48008 Bilbao, Spain10aWhole-farm models to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and their potential use for linking climate change mitigation and adaptation in temperate grassland ruminant-based farming systems  ap. 373-385.  aThe farm level is the most appropriate scale for evaluating options for mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, because the farm represents the unit at which management decisions in livestock production are made. To date, a number of whole farm modelling approaches have been developed to quantify GHG emissions and explore climate change mitigation strategies for livestock systems. This paper analyses the limitations and strengths of the different existing approaches for modelling GHG mitigation by considering basic model structures, approaches for simulating GHG emissions from various farm components and the sensitivity of GHG outputs and mitigation measures to different approaches.

However, predictions of future climate effects on cold-water freshwater fish populations have typically focused only on the ecological consequences of increasing temperatures, overlooking the concurrent and interacting effects of climate-driven changes in streamflow regimes. Here, we present simulations that contrasted the consequences of changes in thermal regime alone versus the combined effects of changes in thermal regime and streamflow for resident trout populations in distinct river types with different sensitivities to climatic change (low-altitude main river vs. high-altitude headwaters). We additionally assessed the buffering effect of increased food production that may be linked to warming. We used an eco-genetic individual-based model that integrates the behavioural and physiological effects of extrinsic environmental drivers –temperature and flow– with intrinsic dynamics –density-dependence, phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary responses – across the entire trout life cycle, with Mediterranean brown trout Salmo trutta as the model species. Our simulations indicated that: (1) Hydrological change is a critical dimension of climate change for the persistence of trout populations, in that neither river type supported viable populations under strong rates of flow change, even under scenarios of increased food production. (2) Climate-change-related environmental change most affects the largest, oldest trout via increased metabolic costs and decreased energy inputs. In both river types, populations persisted under extreme warming alone but became dominated by younger, smaller fish. (3) Density-dependent, plastic and evolutionary changes in phenology and life-history traits provide trout populations with important resilience to warming, but strong concurrent shifts in streamflow could exceed the buffering conferred by such intrinsic dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aSalmo trutta 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afish communities 3afood production 3afreshwater fish 3alife history 3amodels 3aphenology 3aphenotypic plasticity 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3arivers 3astream flow 3atemperature 3atrout 3awater 3aMediterranean region 0aHydrological change 0aClimate vulnerability 0aIndividual-based modelling 0aBioenergetics 0aBrown trout1 aRailsback, Steven F.eauthoruLang Railsback & Associates, Arcata, CA, USA1 aHarvey, Bret C.eauthoruPacific Southwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Arcata, CA, USA1 aQuirós, Inmaculada GarcíaeauthoruHelmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ, Department of Computational Hydrosystems, Leipzig, Germany1 aNicola, Graciela G.eauthoruUniversity of Castilla-La Mancha, Department of Environmental Sciences, Toledo, Spain1 aElvira, BenignoeauthoruComplutense University of Madrid, Faculty of Biology, Department of Biodiversity, Ecology and Evolution, Madrid, Spain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6127-53021 aAlmodóvar, AnaeauthoruComplutense University of Madrid, Faculty of Biology, Department of Biodiversity, Ecology and Evolution, Madrid, Spain0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 July 27,  p.133648-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl445540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1336483Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4455b0048-9697e133648  fScience of the total environment  aBatch:2292  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6065527049ExL  a2019-08-20  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/763650125253420874-00001-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0048969719335740.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2292 reviewed on 2019-08-20T14:00:04Z  aagid:6552704  a2019-08-01  a2019-10-1705133nab a2200889 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098024003800139024004500177035002800222040001800250100023500268245011300503300001400616506007600630506003100706520122000737592002801957593001801985596007002003596008102073596006802154596006602222596006302288506003702351650004302388650001202431650001902443650002402462650001502486650002502501650001302526650001302539650001102552650001102563650002202574650000902596650001402605650001602619653003302635653001902668653002702687653001402714653001702728653001202745700011002757700011502867700009302982700010203075700011603177700011603293773014303409787003303552787001803585787002403603856008503627856004503712912001203757914004203769914001903811916001503830917001103845918003603856935002203892949001503914953007003929954007103999955004504070961001704115962004704132962001704179974001704196983001504213984001504228991584342320742620221215143057.0190415e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058405822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funeco.2017.10.0022chorus7 a10.1016/j.funeco.2017.10.0022doi7 a10.1016/j.funeco.2017.10.0022chorusOpen  aagid:5840582-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlaughter, Lindsey C.eauthoruDepartment of Plant and Soil Science, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA; Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9918-620910aClimate change and Epichloë coenophiala association modify belowground fungal symbioses of tall fescue host  ap. 37-46.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aHuman alteration of symbiont genetics among aboveground endophytic Epichloë coenophiala strains within tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus) has led to widespread deployment of novel grass-endophyte combinations, yet little is known about their ecological consequences. In this study, clone pairs (endophyte-infected, endophyte-free) of two tall fescue genotypes received factorial combinations of increased temperature (+3 °C) and precipitation (+30% long-term annual mean) for 2 yr. We measured root arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), dark septate endophyte (DSE) colonization, and soil AMF extraradical hyphae (ERH) length. We hypothesized that genetically distinct grass-E. coenophiala associations would differentially affect belowground fungi, and that these relationships would be climate-sensitive. Tall fescue genotype, endophyte presence, and climate treatment interactions affected AMF arbuscules, vesicles, and ERH. DSE decreased with E. coenophiala presence but increased with warming. Genetically distinct tall fescue-E. coenophiala associations may have divergent long-term impacts on other host-symbiont interactions, potentially impacting ecosystem function and response to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cKentucky Agricultural Experiment Stationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011136  cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006435  cU.S. Department of Energydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006151  cUniversity of Kentuckydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000074720 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFestuca arundinacea subsp. arundinacea 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecological function 3aendophytes 3aenvironmental impact 3agenetics 3agenotype 3ahumans 3ahyphae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asoil 3asymbionts 3atemperature 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aClimate change 0aDark septate endophyte 0aGrassland 0aNeotyphodium 0aWarming1 aNelson, Jim A.eauthoruDepartment of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA1 aCarlisle, ElizabetheauthoruDepartment of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA1 aBourguignon, MarieeauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA1 aDinkins, Randy D.eauthoruUSDA–ARS, Forage-Animal Production Research Unit, Lexington, KY, USA1 aPhillips, Timothy D.eauthoruDepartment of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA1 aMcCulley, Rebecca L.eauthoruDepartment of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA0 tFungal ecology.g2018 Feb., v. 31 p.37-46dElsevier LtdaElsevier Ltd and British Mycological SocietywJournal:J000000080x1754-50487nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)J00000008040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2017.10.0023Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5840582  aArticle  aJournal:J000000080b1754-5048c31e37  fFungal ecology  aBatch:1888  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6058405829ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00106-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S1754504817301228.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1878-0083  aMissing ISSN  aagid:5840582  a2019-04-15  a2022-09-0605469nab a2200901 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024001700121024002800138024002500166024004000191024002300231035002800254040001800282100015400300245012900454300001600583520146100599593001802060595005602078593002002134650003102154650001602185650003402201650001302235650002802248650002002276650003002296650001902326650003002345650001902375650000902394650001602403650001802419650001602437650001302453650003002466650002202496650001902518650001302537650002402550650001502574651000902589651002202598700009902620700009802719700011602817700011402933700011303047700012203160700012503282700011203407700010903519700012703628700009503755700011203850700011503962773008204077787003304159787001804192787001804210856007804228912001204306914004204318914001904360916001604379917001104395935002204406949001504428952001504443961001504458962004704473974001704520983001504537984001504552991584644820742620221214225852.0201113s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071759092DNAL7 a10113/71759092hdl7 a3726342aris7 a10.3390/su121876302doi7 a4323052aris_accn_no7 a5030-13000-011-00D2aris_project_no7 a3726342seq_no_115  aagid:7175909-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalone, RoberteauthoruUSDA-ARS, National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, Ames, IA 50011, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5498-386410aDrainage N loads under climate change with winter rye cover crop in a northern Mississippi River Basin corn-soybean rotation  ap. 7630-18.  aTo help reduce N loads entering the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River 45% by 2035, Iowa set the goal of reducing non-point source N loads 41%. Implementing winter rye cover crop into agricultural systems is one of the more promising strategies to reduce N loads to subsurface drainage, but its effectiveness in the Mississippi River Basin under expected climate change is uncertain. We used the tested Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) to estimate N loads to drainage and crop yield in a central Iowa corn-soybean rotation both with and without winter rye cover crop under: 1) observed weather and ambient CO2 (1991–2011, baseline, BL_CC and BL_NCC) and 2) projected future temperature and precipitation change from six Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and elevated CO2 (2065-2085; CC and NCC). Average annual N loads to drainage under NCC, BL_NCC, CC and BL_CC were 64.0, 47.5, 17.1, and 18.9 kg N/ha. N load to drainage was reduced with CC compared to BL_NCC more than 41% for 18 to 21 years depending on the GCM. Under projected climate change, average annual simulated crop yield differences between scenarios with and without winter rye were approximately 0.1 Mg/ha. These results suggest that implementing winter rye cover crop in a corn-soybean rotation effectively addresses the goal of N load reduction to drainage under climate change in a northern Mississippi River Basin agricultural system without affecting cash crop production.  aPubAg article  a773balice.allenc2021-07-30damanda.xue2021-07-31  eARIS manuscript 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aGlycine max 3aRoot Zone Water Quality Model 3aZea mays 3aagricultural watersheds 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acover crops 3acrop rotation 3agrain yield 3anitrogen 3anonpoint source pollution 3apollution control 3apollution load 3asoybeans 3asubsurface drainage 3awinter rye 3aIowa 3aMississippi River1 aGarbrecht, JurgeneauthoruUSDA-ARS, Grazing lands Research Laboratory, El Reno, OK 73036, USA1 aBusteed, PhillipeauthoruUSDA-ARS, Grazing lands Research Laboratory, El Reno, OK 73036, USA1 aHatfield, JerryeauthoruUSDA-ARS, National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, Ames, IA 50011, USA1 aTodey, DenniseauthoruUSDA-ARS, National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, Ames, IA 50011, USA1 aGerlitz, JadeeauthoruDepartment of Ag & Biosystems Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA1 aFang, QuanxiaoeauthoruInstitute of Soil and Water Conservation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yangling 712100, China1 aSima, MattheweauthoruDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA1 aRadke, AnnaeauthoruUSDA-ARS, National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, Ames, IA 50011, USA1 aMa, LiwangeauthoruUSDA-ARS, Rangeland Resources and Systems Research Unit, Fort Collins, CO 80526, USA1 aQi, ZhimingeauthoruDepartment of Bioresource Engineering, McGill University, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC H9X 3V9, Canada1 aWu, HuaiqingeauthoruDepartment of Statistics, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA1 aJaynes, DaneauthoruUSDA-ARS, National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, Ames, IA 50011, USA1 aKaspar, ThomaseauthoruUSDA-ARS, National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, Ames, IA 50011, USA0 tSustainability.g2020, v. 12, no. 18 p.7630-18wJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)227040uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su121876303Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:2270b2071-1050c12d18e7630  fSustainability  aBatch:10175  aissued  aIND6071759099ExL  a2021-12-23  dgolden set  aUSDAbUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 2071-1050  aagid:7175909  a2020-11-13  a2021-12-2303719nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100011600180245015400296300001600450500001400466520133200480593001801812593001801830595005601848650002701904650001201931650001901943650001201962650002301974650002501997650001602022650001202038650001102050650001102061650001302072650002002085650001502105650000902120650001602129651001502145651001102160651001002171651000902181651001302190651001002203700011602213700011202329700011002441773011402551787003302665787001802698787002402716856004902740912001202789914002302801914003102824916001502855917001102870935002202881949001502903961000902918962004702927974001702974983001502991984001503006991585061510742620221119003023.0201112s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071748752DNAL7 a10.1007/s42161-020-00502-92doi  aagid:7174875-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShukla, Prabhat KumareauthoruICAR- Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture, Lucknow, UP 226 101, India10aMaxEnt prediction for potential risk of mango wilt caused by Ceratocystis fimbriata Ellis and Halst under different climate change scenarios in India  ap. 765-773.  aNAL-light  aWilt of mango caused by Ceratocystis fimbriata has become a great threat to mango production in Bangladesh, Brazil, Oman, Pakistan, Spain and very recently in India also. In the present study potential distribution of mango wilt in India was predicted under different climate change scenarios by ecological niche modeling by MaxEnt. Study revealed that cutting across the different scenarios precipitation of wettest month, precipitation seasonality, temperature seasonality, isothermality were the significant factors in determining the disease distribution. Highest suitability areas for the disease occurrence under current scenario was predicted in southern parts of Jammu and Kashmir, southern Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, western and central Uttar Pradesh, western part of Bihar, western part of Maharashtra and Karnataka. Under future climate scenarios in 2050 highest suitability areas were predicted in parts of southern Jammu and Kashmir and western Bihar; whereas in 2070 scenario the highest suitability of disease occurrence was predicted in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu Kashmir, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. This study provides important information on the risk of C. fimbriata wilt using a MaxEnt model in India. The results can be utilized in strategic planning to prevent further spread of disease.  aPubAg article  dKeyed article  a676balice.allenc2020-12-03damanda.xue2020-12-25 3aCeratocystis fimbriata 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acutting 3adisease occurrence 3adisease transmission 3ainformation 3amangoes 3amodels 3aniches 3aplanning 3aplant pathology 3aprediction 3arisk 3atemperature 3aBangladesh 3aBrazil 3aIndia 3aOman 3aPakistan 3aSpain1 aBaradevanal, GundappaeauthoruICAR- Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture, Lucknow, UP 226 101, India1 aRajan, ShailendraeauthoruICAR- Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture, Lucknow, UP 226 101, India1 aFatima, TahseeneauthoruICAR- Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture, Lucknow, UP 226 101, India0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2020, v. 102, no. 3 p.765-773dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl418144340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42161-020-00502-9  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4181443  fJournal of plant pathology  aBatch:2643  aissued  aIND6071748759ExL  a2021-02-25  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 2239-7264  aagid:7174875  a2020-11-12  a2021-02-2504140nab a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003300098035002800131040001800159100020100177245009800378520153800476592002802014593001802042650001902060650001702079650001202096650001902108650001202127650003002139650001702169650003102186650002102217650001502238650001702253650002002270650001602290650001002306700003302316700003302349700003402382700003302416700003302449700003102482700019802513773012102711787003302832787001802865787001902883856007902902912001202981914003502993914001303028916001503041917001103056918006703067935002203134949001503156953007103171954007503242955004103317961001303358962004803371974001703419983001503436984001503451991585625500742620221119084302.0190614e20180817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064692782DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy80801522doi  aagid:6469278-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiska, Lewis  H.eauthoruAdaptive Cropping Systems Laboratory, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Beltsville, MD 20705, USA. L.Ziska@ars.usda.gov10aClimate Change, Carbon Dioxide, and Pest Biology, Managing the Future: Coffee as a Case Study  aThe challenge of maintaining sufficient food, feed, fiber, and forests, for a projected end of century population of between 9&ndash;10 billion in the context of a climate averaging 2&ndash;4 &deg;C warmer, is a global imperative. However, climate change is likely to alter the geographic ranges and impacts for a variety of insect pests, plant pathogens, and weeds, and the consequences for managed systems, particularly agriculture, remain uncertain. That uncertainty is related, in part, to whether pest management practices (e.g., biological, chemical, cultural, etc.) can adapt to climate/CO<inf>2</inf> induced changes in pest biology to minimize potential loss. The ongoing and projected changes in CO<inf>2</inf>, environment, managed plant systems, and pest interactions, necessitates an assessment of current management practices and, if warranted, development of viable alternative strategies to counter damage from invasive alien species and evolving native pest populations. We provide an overview of the interactions regarding pest biology and climate/CO<inf>2</inf>; assess these interactions currently using coffee as a case study; identify the potential vulnerabilities regarding future pest impacts; and discuss possible adaptive strategies, including early detection and rapid response via EDDMapS (Early Detection & Distribution Mapping System), and integrated pest management (IPM), as adaptive means to improve monitoring pest movements and minimizing biotic losses while improving the efficacy of pest control.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3ainsect pests 3aintegrated pest management 3ainvasive species 3amonitoring 3apest control 3aplant pathogens 3auncertainty 3aweeds1 aBradley, Bethany  A.eauthor1 aWallace, Rebekah  D.eauthor1 aBargeron, Charles  T.eauthor1 aLaForest, Joseph  H.eauthor1 aChoudhury, Robin  A.eauthor1 aGarrett, Karen  A.eauthor1 aVega, Fernando  E.eauthoruSustainable Perennial Crops Laboratory, United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Beltsville, MD 20705, USA.

This study was conducted to evaluate the impacts of long-term management and climate on runoff from a small watershed managed with   no-till (NT) system. The Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX), a field scale hydrologic model which is capable of simulating the management and climate impacts on runoff, was used in this study. The specific objectives of the study were to (1) simulate the impacts of cropping management and tillage system on runoff and (2) simulate climate change impacts on runoff using different temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide (CO2) scenarios generated from the APEX model. The study was conducted on a small watershed located on the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed (NAEW) near   Coshocton, Ohio. This watershed (WS 118, ~0.79 ha [1.95 ac]) includes NT management with two periods of crop rotations: corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean (Glycine max L.)–rye (Secale cereale L.) (CSR; 2000 to 2005) and continuous corn (CC; 2006 to 2011). The results from this study indicate that the CSR rotation showed 37% lower simulated mean annual runoff compared with that of CC under NT system. The   climate change scenarios indicated runoff was most sensitive to the precipitation, and interactions of precipitation, temperature, and CO2 concentrations. The highest increase of runoff (61%) was observed with 15% increase of precipitation, and the highest reduction in runoff (47%) with 15% decrease in precipitation, demonstrating the nonlinearity of hydrological systems. The results demonstrate the benefits of cover crops in the CSR over the CC rotation under NT system and show the significant impacts of climate change on runoff response from a small, upland, agricultural watershed.

(2013) argue that grazing by large ungulates (both native and domestic) should be eliminated or greatly reduced on western public lands to reduce potential climate change impacts. The authors were selective in their use of the scientific literature, and their publication is more of an opinion article than a synthesis. Their conclusions do not reflect the complexities associated with herbivore grazing. Interactions of climate change and grazing will depend on the specific situation. For example, increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperatures may increase both accumulation of fine fuels (primarily grasses) and thus increase wildfire risk. Prescribed grazing by livestock is one of the few management tools available for reducing fine fuel accumulation. While there are certainly points on the landscape where herbivore impacts can be identified, there are also vast grazed areas where impacts are minimal. Broad scale reduction of domestic and wild herbivores to help native plant communities cope with climate change will be unnecessary because over the past 20 to 50 years land managers have actively sought to bring populations of native and domestic herbivores in balance with the potential of vegetation and soils. To cope with a changing climate, land managers will need access to all available vegetation management tools, including grazing.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article  eARIS manuscript 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afuel loading 3afuels 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3aindigenous species 3aland management 3alivestock 3amanagers 3aplant communities 3apublic lands 3arisk 3asoil 3atemperature 3aungulates 3avegetation 3awildfires 2aClimate Change 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEcosystem1 aBoyd, Chadeauthor1 aDavies, Kirkeauthor1 aMadsen, Mattheweauthor1 aBates, Joneauthor1 aSheley, Rogereauthor1 aMarlow, Claytoneauthor1 aBohnert, Davideauthor1 aBorman, Mikeeauthor1 aMata-Gonzalez, Ricardoeauthor1 aBuckhouse, Johneauthor1 aStringham, Tamzeneauthor1 aPerryman, Barryeauthor1 aSwanson, Shermaneauthor1 aTate, Kennetheauthor1 aGeorge, Meleauthor1 aRuyle, Georgeeauthor1 aRoundy, Bruceeauthor1 aCall, Chriseauthor1 aJensen, Kevineauthor1 aLaunchbaugh, Kareneauthor1 aGearhart, Amandaeauthor1 aVermeire, Lanceeauthor1 aTanaka, Johneauthor1 aDerner, Justineauthor1 aFrasier, Garyeauthor1 aHavstad, Kriseauthor0 tEnvironmental management.g2014 June, v. 53, no. 6 p.1035-1038dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl801440uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/587863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-013-0218-2  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8014b0364-152Xc53d6e1035  fEnvironmental management  aissued  aIND5008933399ExL  a2014-06-06  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/296238%20Western%20land%20managers%20will%20need%20all%20available%20tools%20for%20adapting%20to%20climate%20change%2C%20including%20grazing%20%20A%20critique%20of%20Beschta%20et%20al.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:550 annotated on 2014-05-26T21:35:50Z  aBatch:550 reviewed on 2014-06-06T04:00:03Z  aBatch:550 reviewed on 2014-06-06T16:00:02Z  aagid:58786  a2014-05-15  a2015-10-29  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans450103670nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003800097024002100135035002600156040001800182072000900200072000900209072000900218100001800227245010300245300001600348500002400364500001500388520126700403593001801670593002001688650003001708650002801738650001701766650002201783650002501805650001401830650001901844650001801863650001301881650002101894650001401915651001801929653002401947653002001971700001701991700001902008700001602027700001702043700001702060773011002077787001802187787003302205787003002238787002102268852000902289856011202298856008802410912001202498914004402510914003402554917001102588930003302599935002102632945002502653946001102678949001502689952005102704961001202755974001502767984001502782985010302797986001202900991603215880742620221123000319.0100115e20100205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443136552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.07.0222doi7 a10113/382162hdl  aagid:38216-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK250 0aB2001 aWoodall, C.W.10aSelecting tree species for testing climate change migration hypotheses using forest inventory data  ap. 778-785.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe lack of objective tree species lists hinders the assessment of climate change effects on tree species distributions. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate criteria for selecting tree species used in large-scale tree migration monitoring efforts. The results of this study indicate that tree migration conclusions are highly dependant on the species selected for examination. It was found that tree species' median latitudes or forecasted future areas provided objective criteria for development of species lists for migration hypothesis testing with the latter being insensitive to simulation error. Furthermore, only 10-15 of the top species, in terms of high median latitudes or loss in forecasted future area, are needed to maximize the sensitivity of a migration index. The use of such criteria in this study indicated a northward shift of sensitive tree populations of 27km. It is suggested that examining species only the most likely to migrate serves as an objective starting point for migration detection. In contrast, the inclusion of all tree species commonly observed in large-scale forest inventories can obfuscate migration detection with tree species that have little ecological reason to immediately migrate in a changing climate.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3ageographical distribution 3ainterspecific variation 3aforest trees 3aindicator species 3aspatial distribution 3aseedlings 3aclimate change 3adata analysis 3alatitude 3aforest inventory 3adetection 3aUnited States 0aspecies differences 0aplant migration1 aOswalt, C.M.1 aWestfall, J.A.1 aPerry, C.H.1 aNelson, M.D.1 aFinley, A.O.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Feb. 5, v.  259, no.  4 p.778-785dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl9013  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/382163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.07.0223Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl9013b0378-1127c259d4e778  fForest ecology and management  aissued  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aIND443136559ExL  aINDdLYNe2010/01/25  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20110518 20110603 00000000bIND LYN 2010/01/25  aUSDA/FS  aagid:38216  a2011-06-03  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a431365502345nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008003300034016002200067024002100089035002600110040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181072000900190072000900199072000900208100001800217245010000235500002400335500001500359593001800374594002200392650002000414650002900434650003000463650002500493650001900518650001700537650002200554650001400576650001500590650001900605650002200624650001800646650002800664650001800692650001700710650001800727653003500745653001700780653001300797700002200810773013100832787001800963787003300981852000901014856011201023912001201135914010501147917001101252930003301263935002101296945002501317946001101342949001501353952005101368961001201419974001501431979002301446984001501469985010301484986001201587991603234050742620221120230056.0100423|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443581402DNAL7 a10113/410402hdl  aagid:41040-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aF300 0aK800 0aF821 0aK810 0aW000 0aK2001 aSolomon, A.M.10aForest responses to global change in North America: interacting forces define a research agenda  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article 3aland use change 3awildland-urban interface 3ageographical distribution 3aphytophagous insects 3aboreal forests 3abark beetles 3atemperate forests 3awildfires 3apollutants 3aclimate change 3aforest management 3aforest growth 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aair pollution 3aforest pests 3aforest health 0aforest-atmosphere interactions 0ainsect pests 0aland use1 aFreer-Smith, P.H.0 tForestry and climate change / edited by Peter H.

The impact of climate change on a brackish water clam found in the lake was then examined using simulated monthly variations of lake salinity and information from prior studies of the clam.ET increased and snow water equivalent decreased for all scenarios incorporating temperature rise, particularly during the winter season. Furthermore, ET and snow water equivalent were not as sensitive to variations in precipitation and thus temperature rise was considered to be a major factor for these variables. Nevertheless, monthly discharge volume was more influenced by variation in precipitation than variations in temperature. Discharge increased during both the summer and winter season, since precipitation contributed to river discharge instead of being stored as snow pack during the winter season. The magnitudes of salinity dilutions and concentrations predicted under the climate change scenarios would not be lethal for adult clams. However, the egg-laying season of the clam would coincide with periods of strong salinity dilution in the lake. Since juveniles are less tolerant to changes in salinity, future generations of the clam may be affected and reproduction of the clam may be reduced by increasing precipitation in the future.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3asimulation models 3arivers 3aevapotranspiration 3alakes 3asalinity 3aair temperature 3aregression analysis 3aclimate change 3awatershed hydrology 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3acase studies 3aJapan 0amathematical models1 aArnold, J.1 aHoffman, D.1 aTakeda, I.1 aMori, Y.1 aDi Luzio, M.0 tHydrological processes.g2009 June 30, v.  23, no.  13 p.1887-1900dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl3938466  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/410113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.73213Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3938466b0885-6087c23d13e1887  fHydrological processes  aissued  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aIND442191819ExL  aINDdGAYe2010/04/26  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20100428 20100501 00000000bIND GAY 2010/04/26  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:41011  a2010-05-01  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a421918102156nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008003300034016002200067024002100089035002600110040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181072000900190100002000199245006200219500002400281500001500305593001800320594002200338650002100360650001900381650002300400650001900423650002800442650001200470650002700482650001800509650002900527650001200556650001900568650002100587650001800608650001800626653002000644653002400664700001400688773013100702787001800833787003300851852000900884856011200893912001201005914010501017917001101122930003301133935002101166945002501187946001101212949001501223952005101238961001301289974001501302979002301317984001501340985010301355986001201458991603253180742620221122122218.0100423|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443581392DNAL7 a10113/410392hdl  aagid:41039-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aW000 0aJ100 0aJ200 0aJ7001 aSchepers, James10aSoils and waste management: a challenge to climate change  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article 3agreenhouse gases 3acarbon dioxide 3aagricultural soils 3aanimal manures 3acrop residue management 3atillage 3afood processing wastes 3acrop residues 3aanimal manure management 3amethane 3aclimate change 3asoil respiration 3agas emissions 3anitrous oxide 0asoil management 0aagricultural wastes1 aLynch, J.0 tForestry and climate change / edited by Peter H.

How do a history of neighbourhood interactions and population‐level dynamics, including demographic transition, impact long‐term tree growth? LOCATION: Natural mature Pinus resinosa‐dominated forest in northern Minnesota, USA. METHODS: Using a spatially explicit data set of repeated diameter measurements recorded over an 87‐yr period, we modelled the influence of tree‐to‐tree interactions on growth as it varied over time. We also applied maximum likelihood estimation and simulated annealing to examine how inter‐ and intraspecific competition and the relative importance of neighbour size and distance varied over time and with different climatic conditions. RESULTS: Crowding had a consistent negative influence on growth, but crowding intensity and importance were dynamic over time and differed between trees that survived the entire study period compared to those that ultimately died. The scaling of neighbour diameter, neighbour distance, and neighbour species (inter‐ vs intraspecific competition) also varied as demographic transition occurred and longer‐lived species assumed greater dominance. CONCLUSIONS: Given observed relationships with moisture stress (based on precipitation: potential evapotranspiration) and maximum temperature, crowding intensity and importance may increase if temperatures rise in the future and water become more limiting. Long‐term data sets, such as the record examined in this study, have immense value for testing assumptions about stand dynamics, particularly as forests respond to projected shifts in climate and disturbance regimes.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aPinus 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest stands 3aforests 3aintraspecific competition 3astand development 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3atree growth 3atrees 3aMinnesota1 aD'Amato, Anthony W.eauthor1 aFraver, ShawneauthoruSchool of Forest Resources, University of Maine, Orono, ME, 04469, USA1 aHuff, Emily S.eauthoruDepartment of Forestry, Michigan State University, 480 Wilson Road, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA1 aPalik, Brian J.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, 1831 Hwy 169 E, Grand Rapids, MN, 55744, USA0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2017 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.82-92dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4682040uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.124713Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46820b1100-9233c28d1e82  fJournal of vegetation science  aBatch:1909  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058775769ExL  a2018-03-01  a11009233_2017_28_1.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1909 reviewed on 2018-03-01T15:00:03Z  aagid:5877576  a2018-01-02  a2018-03-0101633nab a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002100097035002600118040001800144072000900162072000900171100002000180245005700200300001100257593001800268594002200286650001900308650002800327650002100355650002300376700001900399773013900418787001800557787003300575852000900608856011200617912001200729914008700741917001100828930003300839935002100872945002500893946000900918949001500927952005100942961001300993974001501006984001501021985010301036986001201139991603506920742620221120154638.0100316e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443404962DNAL7 a10113/398082hdl  aagid:39808-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aJ7001 aWeinberg, Marca10aMitigating Climate Change: Opportunities for Farmers  ap. 10.  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article 3aclimate change 3asustainable agriculture 3agreenhouse gases 3afarmers' attitudes1 aHorowitz, John0 tAmber waves : the economics of food, farming, natural resources, and rural America.g2010 Mar., v.  8, no.  1 p.10-10x1545-875X7nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/398083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  fAmber waves : the economics of food, farming, natural resources, and rural America  aissued  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aIND443404969ExL  aINDdMWLe2010/03/29  aUSDA  a2014-07-17  a20100330 20100403 00000000bIND MWL 2010/03/29  aUSDA/ERS  aagid:39808  a2010-04-03  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a434049605072nab a2200829 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100017300182245006600355300001600421520206800437592002802505593001802533650001302551650001102564650001902575650002302594650002602617650002002643650002602663650002102689650001802710650001702728650001702745650002502762650001902787650002202806650001302828650002902841650001402870650001602884650002302900650000902923650002202932650001902954650001502973650001202988650001403000651002403014653002303038653001303061653002103074653002503095653001503120700012603135700012803261700014803389773011703537787003303654787001803687787002103705856008503726912001203811914004103823914003403864916001503898917001103913918003603924935002203960949001503982953007003997954007104067955004504138961001204183974001704195983001504212984001504227991603754570742620221120042138.0190403e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054251592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.09.0492doi  aagid:5425159-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Kenneth L.eauthoruSilas Little Experimental Forest, Northern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 501 Four Mile Road, P.O. Box 232, New Lisbon, NJ 08064, USA10aClimate change and fire management in the mid-Atlantic region  ap. 306-315.  aIn this review, we summarize the potential impacts of climate change on wildfire activity in the mid-Atlantic region, and then consider how the beneficial uses of prescribed fire could conflict with mitigation needs for climate change, focusing on patters of carbon (C) sequestration by forests in the region. We use a synthesis of field studies, eddy flux tower measurements, and simulation studies to evaluate how the use of prescribed fire affects short- and long-term forest C dynamics. Climate change may create weather conditions more conducive to wildfire activity, but successional changes in forest composition, altered gap dynamics, reduced understory and forest floor fuels, and fire suppression will likely continue to limit wildfire occurrence and severity throughout the region. Prescribed burning is the only major viable option that land managers have for reducing hazardous fuels in a cost-effective manner, or ensuring the regeneration and maintenance of fire-dependent species. Field measurements and model simulations indicate that consumption of fine fuels on the forest floor and understory vegetation during most prescribed burns is equivalent to <1–3years of sequestered C, and depends on pre-burn fuel loading and burn intensity. Overstory tree mortality is typically low, and stands have somewhat reduced daytime C uptake during the next growing season following burns, but may also have reduced rates of ecosystem respiration. On an annual basis, net ecosystem productivity is negative the first year when consumption losses are included, but then positive in following years, and stands can reach C neutrality within <2–3years. Field data and model simulations suggest that increases in prescribed burning in fire-prone areas would have little appreciable effect on long-term forest C dynamics in some fire-prone forest types. Large-scale conversion to young pine plantations for fiber and biofuels will potentially increase the risk of wildfires, as had occurred previously in the late-19th and early-20th centuries in the region.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3aecosystem respiration 3aeddy covariance 3afield experimentation 3afire suppression 3aforest litter 3aforest types 3afuel loading 3afuels (fire ecology) 3agrowing season 3along term effects 3amanagers 3anet ecosystem production 3aoverstory 3aplantations 3aprescribed burning 3arisk 3asimulation models 3atree mortality 3aunderstory 3aweather 3awildfires 3aMid-Atlantic region 0aForest composition 0aWildfire 0aPrescribed burns 0aCarbon sequestration 0aMitigation1 aSkowronski, NicholaseauthoruNorthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 180 Canfield St., Morgantown, WV 26505, USA1 aRenninger, HeidieauthoruRutgers University, Department of Biological Sciences, 195 University Ave., Newark, NJ 07102, USA1 aScheller, RoberteauthoruDepartment of Environmental Sciences and Management, Portland State University, P.O.

Using field data and two future climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the period 2020–2039, this study evaluated three common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars planted under rainfed conditions at different densities in two locations in the north-central Mexican semi-arid temperate highlands. The sowing densities were 90,000, 145,000, and 260,000 plants ha-1 established in single rows (SR), three rows (3R), and six rows (6R), respectively. The climate change scenarios were derived from an assembly model integrating 11 general circulation models (GCM) selected for Mexico with a 30" arc resolution. The baseline climate was for the period 1961–2010. The ALMANACMEX model (USDA-ARS-INIFAP, Temple, USA) was parameterized and evaluated and then re-run using the climate scenarios. Beans planted at 6R showed the highest increase in seed yield in both climate scenarios, although the response varied by cultivar and time periods. For the growth habit III cultivars, Flor de Mayo Bajio showed no difference in yield, while Pinto Saltillo, a drought-resistant cultivar, showed increases of 13% to 16% at 6R only until 2033. Growth habit I cultivar Azufrado 2 showed more than 60% increases at 6R in both climate scenarios for the full period 2020–2039. These results suggest that considering the projected climate conditions, high sowing densities may be a viable agronomic option for common bean production under rainfed conditions in semi-arid temperate regions, such as the highlands of Mexico, in the near future; however, the selection of the cultivar is a key element to consider in this regard.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  a508bksichelmc2020-04-29damanda.xue2020-04-30  eARIS manuscript 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aagronomy 3abeans 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agrowth habit 3aseed yield 3aMexico1 aFajardo-Diaz, RicardoeauthoruAutonomous University of Aguascalientes, Basic Sciences Center, Av.

The scenarios combine natural climate variability, as captured by a vector autoregressive (VAR) model, with a range of climate trends calculated from 31 models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The methodology translates these climate scenarios into plausible daily sequences of climate variables utilizing the Agricultural Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (AgMERRA) dataset. The new dataset (VARAG) has several advantages over traditional general circulation model outputs, such as, the statistical representation of short-term natural climate variability, availability at a daily time scale and high spatial resolution, not requiring additional downscaling, and the use of the AgMERRA data which is bias-corrected extensively. To assess the associated impacts on basin hydrology, the semi-distributed Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land-surface model is forced with the climate scenarios, after being calibrated for the study area using the fine-resolution (0.05°) merged satellite and in-situ observation-based dataset, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). The climate data are further bias-corrected by applying a non-parametric quantile mapping scheme, where the cumulative distribution functions are approximated using kernel densities. Three different wetness scenarios (dry, average, and wet) are analyzed to see the potential short-term changes in the basin. We find that the precipitation bias correction is more in effect in the mountainous sub-basins, one of which also shows the maximum difference between the wet and dry scenario streamflows. Precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture show increasing trends mostly during the primary rainy season, while no trend is found in the corresponding streamflows. The annual values of these variables also do not change much in the coming three decades. The methodology implemented in this study provides a reliable range of possibilities which can greatly benefit risk analysis and infrastructure designing, and shows potential to be applied to other basins.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3abasins 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acumulative distribution 3adata collection 3aevapotranspiration 3ainfrastructure 3ameteorological data 3amountains 3aretrospective studies 3asatellites 3asoil water 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aEastern Africa 0aShort-term climate change impacts 0aVARAG data 0aNatural climate variability 0aBias correction 0aVIC model 0aMara River basin1 aValdés, Juan B.eauthoruHydrology and Atmospheric Sciences, The University of Arizona, Tucson, United States1 aLyon, BradfieldeauthoruClimate Change Institute, The University of Maine, Orono, United States1 aDemaria, Eleonora M.C.eauthoruUSDA Agricultural Research Service, Tucson, United States1 aSerrat-Capdevila, AleixeauthoruWater Global Practice, The World Bank, Washington, DC, United States1 aGupta, Hoshin V.eauthoruHydrology and Atmospheric Sciences, The University of Arizona, Tucson, United States1 aValdés-Pineda, RodrigoeauthoruHydrology and Atmospheric Sciences, The University of Arizona, Tucson, United States1 aDurcik, MatejeauthoruBiosphere 2, The University of Arizona, Tucson, United States1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1693-62520 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Nov., v. 566 p.818-829dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4653940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.08.0513Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/62263263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46539b0022-1694c566e818  fJournal of hydrology  aBatch:2122  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6062263269ExL  a2019-06-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00010-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0022169418306474.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2482.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aagid:6226326  a2019-03-18  a2019-06-18  ans1664106491nab a2200877 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003000098035002800128040001800156100015900174245009700333300001600430520189800446592002802344593001802372650002002390650001302410650001202423650001902435650001702454650001202471650001902483650001902502650002902521650001702550650001902567650001602586650000902602650001602611650002402627650001102651650001002662651001702672653001902689653001002708653001702718653001502735653001702750700015702767700013602924700016403060700016303224700016003387700016203547700016403709700016003873700012904033700016304162700016204325700023204487700009004719700007804809700012004887773012405007787003305131787001805164787001805182856007605200912001205276914004005288914003805328916001505366917001105381918003105392935002205423949001505445953003405460961001305494962004805507962001105555974001705566983001505583984001505598991604762890742620221120120421.0160328e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051712522DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps2011-1922doi  aagid:5171252-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, HongeauthoruSemiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Box 1030, Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada S9H 3X210aShort Communication: Climate change and biofuel wheat: A case study of southern Saskatchewan  ap. 421-425.  aWang, H., He, Y., Qian, B., McConkey, B., Cutforth, H., McCaig, T., McLeod, G., Zentner, R., DePauw, R., Lemke, R., Brandt, K., Liu, T., Qin, X., White, J., Hunt, T. and Hoogenboom, G. 2012. Short Communication: Climate change and biofuel wheat: A case study of southern Saskatchewan. Can. J. Plant Sci. 92: 421–425. This study assessed potential impacts of climate change on wheat production as a biofuel crop in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer-Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM) was used to simulate biomass and grain yield under three climate change scenarios (CGCM3 with the forcing scenarios of IPCC SRES A1B, A2 and B1) in the 2050s. Synthetic 300-yr weather data were generated by the AAFC stochastic weather generator for the baseline period (1961–1990) and each scenario. Compared with the baseline, precipitation is projected to increase in every month under all three scenarios except in July and August and in June for A2, when it is projected to decrease. Annual mean air temperature is projected to increase by 3.2, 3.6 and 2.7°C for A1B, A2 and B1, respectively. The model predicted increases in biomass by 28, 12 and 16% without the direct effect of CO₂ and 74, 55 and 41% with combined effects (climate and CO₂) for A1B, A2 and B1, respectively. Similar increases were found for grain yield. However, the occurrence of heat shock (>32°C) will increase during grain filling under the projected climate conditions and could cause severe yield reduction, which was not simulated by DSSAT-CSM. This implies that the future yield under climate scenarios might have been overestimated by DSSAT-CSM; therefore, model modification is required. Several measures, such as early seeding, must be taken to avoid heat damages and take the advantage of projected increases in temperature and precipitation in the early season.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aair temperature 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adecision support systems 3aenergy crops 3afilling period 3agrain yield 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ameteorological data 3asowing 3awheat 3aSaskatchewan 0aClimate change 0awheat 0abiofuel crop 0aheat shock 0aseeding date1 aHe, YongeauthoruSemiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Box 1030, Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada S9H 3X21 aQian, BudongeauthoruEastern Cereal and Oilseed Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1A 0C61 aMcConkey, BrianeauthoruSemiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Box 1030, Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada S9H 3X21 aCutforth, HerbeauthoruSemiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Box 1030, Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada S9H 3X21 aMcCaig, TomeauthoruSemiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Box 1030, Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada S9H 3X21 aMcLeod, GranteauthoruSemiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Box 1030, Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada S9H 3X21 aZentner, RoberteauthoruSemiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Box 1030, Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada S9H 3X21 aDePauw, RoneauthoruSemiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Box 1030, Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada S9H 3X21 aLemke, ReynaldeauthoruSaskatoon Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada S7N 5A81 aBrandt, KelseyeauthoruSemiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Box 1030, Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada S9H 3X21 aLiu, TingtingeauthoruSemiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Box 1030, Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada S9H 3X21 aQin, XiaoboeauthoruInstitute of Agro-Environment and Sustainable Development, Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences/The Key Laboratory for Agro-Environment and Climate Change, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing, 100081, China1 aWhite, JeffreyeauthoruUSDA ARS, ALARC, 21881 N Cardon Lane, Maricopa, AZ 85138, USA1 aHunt, TonyeauthoruUniversity of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W11 aHoogenboom, GerriteauthoruWashington State University, 24106 North Bunn Road, Prosser, Washington 99350-8694, USA0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2012 May, v. 92, no. 3 p.421-425dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)193340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps2011-1923Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:1933b1918-1833c92d3e421  fCanadian journal of plant science  aBatch:1389  aissued2 aNRC Canadaeprovider5DNAL  aIND6051712529ExL  a2016-08-22  aCJPSv92i3-04170743-212210.zip  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:1389 reviewed on 2016-08-22T13:00:02Z  aNo DOI  aagid:5171252  a2016-03-28  a2017-02-0607179nab a2200877 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100015600180245014100336300001100477520201700488592002802505593001802533596005002551596006902601596016702670596016702837650002403004650001103028650001903039650001203058650001903070650000903089650002003098650001303118650001403131650001303145650000903158650000903167650001503176650001603191650001603207650001003223700010903233700014503342700010603487700014103593700017703734700014103911700015004052700016604202700012204368700012804490700012404618700013704742700011204879700012804991700014405119700012705263700011405390700013705504773011205641787003305753787001805786787002105804856008305825912001205908914004505920914002005965916001605985917001106001918002906012935002206041949001506063953006706078954005906145955003706204961001306241974001706254983001506271984001506286991605450570742620221120212242.0220831e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077887012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-022-03375-22doi  aagid:7788701-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, EnlieauthoruCSIRO Agriculture and Food, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT, 2601, Australia.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted with a combination of five levels of atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, seven temperature changes, five precipitation changes, together with five nitrogen application rates. Our results were in several aspects different from those of previous model inter-comparison studies for wheat, maize, rice, and potato crops. A partial model calibration only on phenology led to very poor simulation of aboveground biomass and seed yield of canola, even from the ensemble median or mean. A full calibration with additional data of leaf area index, biomass, and yield from one treatment at each site reduced simulation error of seed yield from 43.8 to 18.0%, but the uncertainty in simulation results remained large. Such calibration (with data from one treatment) was not able to constrain model parameters to reduce simulation uncertainty across the wide range of environments. Using a multi-model ensemble mean or median reduced the uncertainty of yield simulations, but the simulation error remained much larger than observation errors, indicating no guarantee that the ensemble mean/median would predict the correct responses. Using multi-model ensemble median, canola yield was projected to decline with rising temperature (2.5–5.7% per °C), but to increase with increasing CO₂ concentration (4.6–8.3% per 100-ppm), rainfall (2.1–6.1% per 10% increase), and nitrogen rates (1.3–6.0% per 10% increase) depending on locations. Due to the large uncertainty, these results need to be treated with caution. We further discuss the need to collect new data to improve modelling of several key physiological processes of canola for increased confidence in future climate impact assessments.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a41905103cNatural Science Foundation of China  a01LL1304AcGerman Federal Ministry of Education 544 and Research  a2007–2013 ESF POR SARDINIA (7/2007RLcScientific Research the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Technological Innovation Promotion in Sardinia  a2007–2013 ESF POR SARDINIA (7/2007RLcScientific Research the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Technological Innovation Promotion in Sardinia 3aaboveground biomass 3acanola 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3aleaf area index 3anitrogen 3aphenology 3apotatoes 3arain 3arice 3aseed yield 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awheat1 aHe, DieauthoruCSIRO Agriculture and Food, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT, 2601, Australia.

It is expected that China will become the world leader in terms of installed offshore wind energy capacity in the upcoming years. A multi-model ensemble of eight simulations from CORDEX project was considered to evaluate future offshore wind energy projections along the Chinese coast under the RCP8.5 warming scenario. Furthermore, offshore wind energy resource was classified attending to the richness of the resource, stability of the resource, risk and economic factors. The reliability of the CORDEX multi-model ensemble was analyzed by comparing CORDEX wind speed with two different datasets: in-situ data from oceanic buoys and ERA5 database. A general wind power density decrease was observed for the near future and the far future. At seasonal scale, differences were found depending on the season. Thus, a clear reduction was projected during spring, whilst increases were observed in wide areas during winter or autumn. Regarding the classification of the future offshore wind energy resource for the upcoming decades, most of the Chinese coastal area was defined as good or excellent due to its high offshore wind energy richness that compensate the low values on stability of the resource and risk factor.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aautumn 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenergy industry 3arisk factors 3aspring 3awind power 3awind speed 3awinter 3aChina 0aOffshore wind energy classification 0aCORDEX1 adeCastro, M.eauthoruEnvironmental Physics Laboratory (EphysLab), CIM-UVIGO, University of Vigo, Campus da Auga Building, 32004, Ourense, Spain1 aCarvalho, D.eauthoruCESAM, Physics Department, University of Aveiro, 3810-193, Aveiro, Portugal1 aFeng, Z.eauthoruCollege of Ocean & Earth Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China1 aGómez-Gesteira, M.eauthoruEnvironmental Physics Laboratory (EphysLab), CIM-UVIGO, University of Vigo, Campus da Auga Building, 32004, Ourense, Spain0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Sept., v. 175 p.731-747dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1197040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:11970b0960-1481  fRenewable energy  aBatch:10186  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6073777809ExL  a2022-02-22  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/113833956452530444-00003-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0960148121006777.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/DA  aagid:7377780  a2021-07-08  a2022-02-1804767nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100015400182245014700336520199700483592002802480593001802508650001702526650001902543650002102562650000902583650001402592650001202606650001002618650001502628650002202643650001602665650003202681650001602713650001002729651001102739653001502750653002202765653002602787653001502813653001802828700015802846700016103004700016003165773011603325787003303441787001803474787002103492856008503513912001203598914004403610914003403654916001503688917001103703918003603714935002203750949001503772953009103787954006103878955003503939961001203974962004803986974001704034983001504051984001504066991605764330742620221121223829.0200509e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068983102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1181392doi  aagid:6898310-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, WushuangeauthoruFaculty of Forestry and Environmental Management, University of New Brunswick, 28 Dineen Drive, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada10aEvaluating the potential of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) to persist under climate change using historic provenance trials in eastern Canada  aRed spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) is an important tree species in northeastern North America. The impact of climate change on this tree species is expected to vary regionally, but may be negative within Canada’s eastern Acadian Forest Region as temperatures there are expected to rise by 2–6 °C by 2100 under the business-as-usual Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 climate forcing scenario. In this study, we use one series of historic provenance trials from northeastern North America to evaluate the capacity of red spruce to persist under climate change by analyzing measurements of tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH) in relation to differences between provenance origin climate and test site climate (i.e., climate differentials).Within the range of climate differentials tested, warming (i.e., when the test site was warmer than provenance origin) did not appear to have a deleterious effect on red spruce growth, but cooling (i.e., moving provenances to colder, more northerly sites) did negatively affect growth by reducing height and diameter. Indeed, warmer temperatures, relative to provenance origin, increased tree size, especially for the most northern provenances, suggesting red spruce at the northern extent of its geographical range in northeastern North America is currently cold suppressed and located in non-optimal climates. However, our capacity to test warming effects on more southerly provenances was limited in this study by lack of available test sites south of red spruce’s climatic range. Among the eight climate variables tested, changes in frost free period and mean annual temperature had the most significant impact on tree size. In general, temperature-related climate variables had stronger effects than moisture-related variables. Overall, our results provide important insight for foresters when considering the future management of red spruce in the Acadian Forest Region and the selection of climate adapted seed source.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aPicea rubens 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acold 3aforesters 3aforests 3afrost 3aprovenance 3aradiative forcing 3atemperature 3atree and stand measurements 3atree height 3atrees 3aCanada 0aRed spruce 0aProvenance trials 0aAcadian Forest Region 0aPlasticity 0aPrecipitation1 aKershaw, John A.eauthoruFaculty of Forestry and Environmental Management, University of New Brunswick, 28 Dineen Drive, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada1 aCostanza, Kara K.L.eauthoruFaculty of Forestry and Environmental Management, University of New Brunswick, 28 Dineen Drive, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada1 aTaylor, Anthony R.eauthoruFaculty of Forestry and Environmental Management, University of New Brunswick, 28 Dineen Drive, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 June 15, v. 466 p.118139-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl901340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1181393Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl9013b0378-1127c466e118139  fForest ecology and management  aBatch:2471  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6068983109ExL  a2020-05-22  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/109462204607484701-00003-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0378112720303753.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2471 reviewed on 2020-05-22T12:00:04Z  aagid:6898310  a2020-05-09  a2020-05-2204419nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098024003600137035002800173040001800201100012300219245009900342506010400441506007600545506003100621520158100652592002802233593001802261596003402279506003702313650001602350650002302366650001602389650001902405650001102424650001802435650001102453650000902464650001302473650001602486653002102502653001602523653001802539653002202557653001902579700008202598700008202680700015802762700010002920773012103020787003303141787001803174787001903192856008303211912001203294914003703306914004503343917001103388918003603399935002203435949001503457953009303472954006103565955003503626961001303661974001703674983001503691984001503706991605944490742620221215143106.0220829e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078629062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jafr.2022.1003482chorus7 a10.1016/j.jafr.2022.1003482doi  aagid:7862906-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Ramandeep KumareauthoruDepartment of Plant and Soil Sciences, Mississippi State University, Mississippi, USA10aImpact of recent climate change on cotton and soybean yields in the southeastern United States  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe Southeastern region of the United States (SE-US) is agroecologically diverse, economically agriculture reliant, and distinct from the twentieth-century warming trend. Considering the inextricable link between climate and agricultural production, it is necessary to quantify future environmental implications on economically important crops of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in the SE-US. The current study used the fixed-effect model (panel data approach) for climate and yield studies, to assess the impact of climatic variables from 1980 to 2020 such as daily maximum temperature (Tₘₐₓ), minimum temperatures (Tₘᵢₙ), and rainfall on cotton and soybean yields. The data from 11 states were averaged per growing season and results revealed significant variability in temperature and rainfall during the last four decades. The Tₘₐₓ, Tₘᵢₙ, and rainfall shifted in the range of 0.46–0.50 °C, 1.30–1.45 °C, and 3.74–3.95 cm, respectively, during the cotton growing season (CGS) and soybean growing seasons (SGS). However, the annual rate of change in Tₘₐₓ, Tₘᵢₙ, and rainfall from 1980 to 2020 was in the range of 0.011–0.012 °C, 0.031–0.034 °C, and 0.089–0.094 cm, respectively, during the CGS and SGS. Rainfall had no significant effect on cotton and soybean yields. A 1 °C rise in Tₘᵢₙ increased cotton yield by 20.8% while decreasing soybean yield by 31.6%. Alternatively, a 1 °C rise in Tₘₐₓ decreased cotton and soybean yield by 10.3% and 25.6%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cAgricultural Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycine max 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aagriculture 3aclimate change 3acotton 3afood research 3amodels 3arain 3asoybeans 3atemperature 0aAbiotic stresses 0aTemperature 0aFood security 0aCrop productivity 0aand Panel data1 aKumar, SunnyeauthoruPunjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, Punjab, India1 aVatta, KamaleauthoruPunjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, Punjab, India1 aDhillon, JagmandeepeauthoruDepartment of Plant and Soil Sciences, Mississippi State University, Mississippi, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6260-51741 aReddy, Krishna N.eauthoruCrop Production Systems Research Unit, USDA-ARS, Stoneville, MS, USA0 tJournal of agriculture and food research.g2022 Sept., v. 9 p.100348-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27273x2666-15437nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2727340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafr.2022.1003483Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:27273b2666-1543e100348  fJournal of agriculture and food research  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6078629069ExL  a2022-08-03  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/139368259653388643-00002-HEAD-ONLY-REVISEDSUBJECTLIST.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S2666154322000813.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:7862906  a2022-08-29  a2022-09-0604991nab a2200769 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100013900171245012500310300001800435500001900453500002000472520215600492592002802648593001802676596003002694596002602724596003702750650002002787650002502807650002702832650002702859650001702886650001202903650001902915650001502934650003002949650001302979650001902992650002303011650001503034650000903049650001103058650001103069650001203080650001003092650001403102700009303116700008203209700008103291700007903372700009603451773012403547787003303671787001803704787002203722856007303744912001203817914004603829914002603875916001603901917001103917918004303928935002203971949001503993953005804008954006204066955003404128961001204162974001704174983001504191984001504206991605984430742620221121105305.0200928e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071151672DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.152812doi  aagid:7115167-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeMoine, Michael T.eauthoruWildlife Biology Program, University of Montana, Missoula, MT, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3605-733510aLandscape resistance mediates native fish species distribution shifts and vulnerability to climate change in riverscapes  ap. 5492-5508.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA broader understanding of how landscape resistance influences climate change vulnerability for many species is needed, as is an understanding of how barriers to dispersal may impact vulnerability. Freshwater biodiversity is at particular risk, but previous studies have focused on popular cold‐water fishes (e.g., salmon, trout, and char) with relatively large body sizes and mobility. Those fishes may be able to track habitat change more adeptly than less mobile species. Smaller, less mobile fishes are rarely represented in studies demonstrating effects of climate change, but depending on their thermal tolerance, they may be particularly vulnerable to environmental change. By revisiting 280 sites over a 20 year interval throughout a warming riverscape, we described changes in occupancy (i.e., site extirpation and colonization probabilities) and assessed the environmental conditions associated with those changes for four fishes spanning a range of body sizes, thermal and habitat preferences. Two larger‐bodied trout species exhibited small changes in site occupancy, with bull trout experiencing a 9.2% (95% CI = 8.3%–10.1%) reduction, mostly in warmer stream reaches, and westslope cutthroat trout experiencing a nonsignificant 1% increase. The small‐bodied cool water slimy sculpin was originally distributed broadly throughout the network and experienced a 48.0% (95% CI = 42.0%–54.0%) reduction in site occupancy with declines common in warmer stream reaches and areas subject to wildfire disturbances. The small‐bodied comparatively warmer water longnose dace primarily occupied larger streams and increased its occurrence in the lower portions of connected tributaries during the study period. Distribution shifts for sculpin and dace were significantly constrained by barriers, which included anthropogenic water diversions, natural step‐pools and cascades in steeper upstream reaches. Our results suggest that aquatic communities exhibit a range of responses to climate change, and that improving passage and fluvial connectivity will be important climate adaptation tactics for conserving aquatic biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSGS Montana Water Center  cUniveristy of Montana  aMONZ17004cUSDA McIntire Stennis 3aCottus cognatus 3aOncorhynchus clarkii 3aRhinichthys cataractae 3aSalvelinus confluentus 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afreshwater 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3aheat tolerance 3aindigenous species 3alandscapes 3arisk 3arivers 3asalmon 3astreams 3atrout 3awildfires1 aEby, Lisa A.eauthoruWildlife Biology Program, University of Montana, Missoula, MT, USA1 aClancy, Chris G.eauthoruMontana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Hamilton, MT, USA1 aNyce, Leslie G.eauthoruMontana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Hamilton, MT, USA1 aJakober, Michael J.eauthoruBitterroot National Forest, Hamilton, MT, USA1 aIsaak, Dan J.eauthoruRocky Mountain Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Boise, ID, USA0 tGlobal change biology.g2020 Oct., v. 26, no. 10 p.5492-5508dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.152813Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c26d10e5492  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:10149  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6071151679ExL  a2021-06-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13541013_2020_26_10.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13541013_2020_26_10.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7115167  a2020-09-28  a2021-06-1804853nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004200098035002800140040001800168100017800186245015200364300001600516520207100532592002802603593001802631650002402649650001202673650001902685650001502704650002102719650002202740650002202762650001702784651001802801653001202819653001402831653002802845653001802873653002002891653001502911653001902926700017002945700013403115700010903249700015103358773010903509787003303618787001803651787001903669856008903688912001203777914003803789914002003827916001503847917001103862918003603873935002203909949001503931953007003946954007104016955004504087961001204132974001704144983001504161984001504176991606196880742620221120212437.0190401e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052571412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.11.0212doi  aagid:5257141-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoudyal, Neelam C.eauthoruDepartment of Forestry, Wildlife, & Fisheries, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, United States1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1230-067913aAn exploratory spatial analysis of projected hotspots of population growth, natural land loss, and climate change in the conterminous United States  ap. 325-334.  aConsidering expected population growth and changes in landuse and climate, it is important to understand whether and where the relative change in one or more of these stressors will most likely impact natural and human systems. This study employed exploratory spatial data analysis of population growth, loss of natural land, and climate change data, all projected at county level for the conterminous United States as part of the USDA Forest Service's 2010 RPA Assessment. Location and geographical extent of projected significant “hotspots” of individual and multiple stressors were analyzed with respect to the location of at-risk natural ecosystems (protected lands, imperiled species) and the social and economic characteristics of human population within and outside the hotspots. While hotspots of projected climate change are broadly distributed across the Southwest, Northern Midwest, and Northeast, hotspots of projected natural land loss clustered in the Southeast and Pacific Northwest, and the primary area of overlap for multiple changes was the Southwest. Most counties in hotspots are currently home to higher numbers of at-risk or listed threatened and endangered (T&E) species than those outside. Also, up to three-quarters of the lands stringently managed to preserve their unique natural and scientific values are projected to be in hotspots of one or more stressors. Findings will be useful in identifying areas in which the greatest emerging land use management challenges will likely be concentrated due to change in one or more stressors. Findings will also inform land use planning decisions, and most importantly, provide information that will prioritize limited resources for mitigation, restoration, and management in areas of highest need. While our analysis shows notable differences in social and economic characteristics of counties projected to be in and outside hotspots, it also suggests the need for an in-depth study to compare sensitivity and adaptive capacity at community scale to compare the vulnerability of communities.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aUSDA Forest Service 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3ahuman population 3aland use planning 3apopulation growth 3aspatial data 3aUnited States 0aLanduse 0aFootprint 0aSpatial autocorrelation 0aVulnerability 0aAt-risk species 0aCommunties 0aRPA assessment1 aElkins, DuncaneauthoruWarnell School of Forestry & Natural Resources, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, United States1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5798-58731 aNibbelink, NathaneauthoruWarnell School of Forestry & Natural Resources, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, United States1 aCordell, H.

We thus assessed this expectation for a global invasive pest, the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis), by determining whether climate variation and transportation activities affect invasion dynamics of this epidemic in California. We found that both temperature fluctuation (growing degree days) and transportation activities (passenger volume) have significant effects on interannual fluctuations of the oriental fruit fly detection events and infested areas. In addition, both detection events and infested areas of the oriental fruit fly were significantly higher in warmer years, while annual precipitation had no significant effects on invasion dynamics of the oriental fruit fly. The growing degree days contributed much more to the invasion dynamics than passenger volume, while passenger volume facilitated an increase in infested area more than growing degree days. Then, we introduced a conceptual framework of synergy model of climate change and transportation activities to illustrate invasion dynamics of the oriental fruit fly, revealing both the invasion dynamics in a fixed cell according to growing degree days and the spatial transmission of invasive alien species by passenger volume. Our findings shed light on the spatial invasion dynamics of alien species, with potential implications for understanding the trajectories of biological invasions under changing future climates and transportation activities.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a31770453cthe National Natural Science Foundation  a2017YFD0200400cNational Key R&D Program of China  eARIS manuscript 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aagroecosystems 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aecological invasion 3afruit flies 3aheat sums 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3atemperature 3atransportation 3aCalifornia1 aReddy, Gadi V.P.eauthor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6377-07211 aReddy, Gadi V.

Evaluation of climate is fundamental to determining the potential success of an introduced or invasive insect pest. However, evaluating climatic suitability poses substantial difficulties; climate can be measured and assessed in a bewildering array of ways. Some physiological filter, in essence a lens that focuses climate through the requirements and constraints of a potential pest introduction, is required. Difficulties in assessing climate suitability are further exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) is an exotic, tree‐defoliating insect that is frequently introduced into the western United States. In spite of an abundance of potential host species, these introductions have yet to result in established populations. The success of eradication efforts and the unsuccessful establishment of many detected and undetected introductions may be related to an inhospitable climate. Climatic suitability for gypsy moth in the western United States, however, is potentially improving, perhaps rapidly, due to a general warming trend that began in the mid 1970s and continues today. In this work, we describe the application of a physiologically based climate suitability model for evaluating risk of gypsy moth establishment on a landscape level. Development of this risk assessment system first required amassing databases that integrated the gypsy moth climatic assessment model, with host species distributions, and climate (historical, present, and future). This integrated system was then used to evaluate climate change scenarios for native host species in Utah, with the result that risk of establishment will dramatically increase during the remainder of the 21st century under reasonable climate change scenarios. We then applied the risk assessment system to several case histories of detected gypsy moth introductions in Utah. These applications demonstrated the general utility of the system for predicting risk of establishment and for designing improved risk detection strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aLymantria dispar 3aintroduced species 3aair temperature 3aphenology 3arisk assessment 3aglobal warming 3aclimate models 3ainsect development 3ainsect ecology 3aforest pests 2aAnimals 2aClimate 2aModels, Theoretical 2aMothsxphysiology 2aRisk Assessment 3aUtah 0aUtah 0aclimate change 0ainsect physiology1 aRégnière, J.eauthoruCanadian Forest Service, Laurentian Forestry Centre, P.O.

Therefore, aggregate estimates of the average effect of warming may be insufficient to model climate change vulnerability. In this study, I propose a quantile model for the distributional effect of climate change. I estimate interquantile regressions of land value on climate using agricultural census data for 464,277 commercial farms in Brazil. I find that the effects of climate change in Brazilian agriculture vary significantly by climate, land quality, and irrigation choice. A 1 °C of warming is more detrimental to farms in warm climates, those with high-quality land, and those using irrigation. A 100-mm decrease in annual precipitation is more damaging to farms in dry climates, those with low-quality land, and those using irrigation. The heterogeneity in climate change effects is particularly large within the subset of farms in the warmest or the driest climates, as the most vulnerable farms appear to be those that have reached their limits for climate adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acensus data 3acommercial farms 3adry climates 3aeconomic impact 3aglobal warming 3airrigated farming 3aland values 3arain 3aBrazil0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Management.g2020 Nov., v. 104dElsevier BVwJournal:12464x0095-06967nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1246440uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2020.1023783Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:12464c104  fJournal of Environmental Economics and Management  aBatch:10197  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073258509ExL  a2022-06-23  dgolden set  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1096-0449  aagid:7325850  a2022-09-01T12:44:03-04:00  a2022-09-29  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl03393nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003600121024003900157035002800196040001800224100013600242245009400378300001400472506007600486506003100562520100300593592002801596593001801624596000901642596005301651506003701704650003001741650001301771650001901784650002501803650002301828650001501851650001301866650001501879650002201894700012901916773012602045787003302171787001802204787001902222856008202241912001202323914002602335914005402361917001102415918002702426935002202453949001502475952001902490955003402509961000902543962004702552974001702599983003002616984001502646985010602661991606604740742620221215143623.0220901e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073258442DNAL7 a10113/73258442hdl7 a10.1016/j.jeem.2018.08.0142doi7 a10.1016/j.jeem.2018.08.0142chorus  aagid:7325844-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, David J.eauthoruDepartment of Applied Economics, Oregon State University, 200 A Ballard Ext.

Even holding land use constant, ecosystem service provision may change through time due to climate change. This paper develops an auction mechanism that implements an optimal solution for providing ecosystem services through time with multiple landowners who have private information about the net benefits of alternative uses of their land. Under the auction, each landowner has a dominant strategy to truthfully reveal their private information. With this information a regulator can then implement the optimal landscape pattern, which maximizes the present value of net benefits derived from the landscape, following the rules of the auction mechanism. The auction can be designed as a subsidy auction that pays landowners to conserve or a tax auction where landowners pay for the right to develop. Our mechanism optimizes social adaptation of ecosystem management to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNOAA  cUSDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadministrative management 3aauctions 3aclimate change 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aland use 3alandscapes 3asocial adjustment1 aPolasky, StepheneauthoruDepartment of Applied Economics, University of Minnesota, 1994 Buford Ave. St. Paul, MN 55108, USA0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Management.g2018 Nov., v. 92 p.20-34dElsevier BVwJournal:12464x0095-06967nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1246440uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2018.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:12464c92e20  fJournal of Environmental Economics and Management  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073258449ExL  a2022-05-05  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1096-0449  aagid:7325844  a2022-09-01T12:43:58-04:00  a2022-09-28  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl03264nab a2200649 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003600121024003900157035002800196040001800224100001100242245009400253506007600347506003100423520100700454592002801461593001801489596004701507506003701554650001601591650003001607650001901637650001501656650000901671650002301680650002001703650001501723700001101738700001101749700001101760773008501771787003301856787001801889787001901907856011401926856008302040912001202123914002702135914005402162916001602216917001102232918002702243935002202270949001502292952001502307955003402322961000902356962003002365962004702395974001702442979003402459984001502493985010602508991606621170742620221215142546.0221002e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073258402DNAL7 a10113/73258402hdl7 a10.1016/j.jeem.2018.01.0052doi7 a10.1016/j.jeem.2018.01.0052chorus  aagid:7325840-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 eauthor10aClimate change, agricultural production and civil conflict: Evidence from the Philippines  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aUsing unique data on conflict-related incidents in the Philippines, we exploit seasonal variation in the relationship between rainfall and agricultural production to learn about the mechanism through which rainfall affects civil conflict. We find that an increase in dry-season rainfall leads to an increase in agricultural production and dampens conflict intensity. By contrast, an increase in wet-season rainfall is harmful to crops and produces more conflict. Consistent with the hypothesis that rebel groups gain strength after a bad harvest, we find that negative rainfall shocks lead to an increase in conflict incidents initiated by insurgents but not by government forces. These results suggest that the predicted shift towards wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons will lead to more civil conflict even if annual rainfall totals remain stable. We conclude that policies aimed at mitigating the effect of climate change on agriculture could have the added benefit of reducing civil conflict.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhilippines 3aagricultural productivity 3aclimate change 3adry season 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3asocial problems 3awet season1 eauthor1 eauthor1 eauthor0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Management.dElsevier BVx0095-06967nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1246440uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73258403Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2018.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:12464c88e379  fJournal of Environmental Economics and Management  aBatch:10196  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073258409ExL  a2022-06-05  dgolden set  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1096-0449  aagid:7325840  aArticle missing volume number  a2022-10-04  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl05414nab a2200913 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004000098024003700138024004400175035002800219040001800247100009300265245011700358300001600475506002800491506003600519506007600555506003100631520171900662592002802381593001802409596010702427596013002534596008802664596004502752596004602797506003702843650001102880650001902891650001102910650001202921650002302933650001602956650001502972650001402987650002703001650001103028650001103039650001103050650000903061650001503070650001203085650002803097650001603125650002003141651001603161653001903177653002303196653002703219653002403246653001603270653001603286700017803302700017603480700010403656773012803760787003303888787001803921787002103939856008403960903002404044912001204068914004104080914003404121916001504155917001104170918003604181935002204217949001504239953007004254954007104324955004504395961001304440974001704453983001504470984001504485991606680450742620221207123028.0190403e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052627752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.12.0032chorus7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.12.0032doi7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.12.0032chorusOpen  aagid:5262775-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Eun-MieauthoruOak Ridge Institute of Science and Engineering, Oak Ridge, TN, USA10aProjected irrigation requirements for upland crops using soil moisture model under climate change in South Korea  ap. 163-180.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAn increase in abnormal climate change patterns and unsustainable irrigation in uplands cause drought and affect agricultural water security, crop productivity, and price fluctuations. In this study, we developed a soil moisture model to project irrigation requirements (IR) for upland crops under climate change using estimated effective rainfall (ER), crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and the IR of 29 major upland crops in South Korea. The temperature and precipitation will increase, but the ER is projected to decrease under climate change. ETc and the net irrigation requirement (NIR) are expected to increase under climate change. Vegetable crops have less ER and more NIR than cereal crops with a similar amount of ETc, which means they are more sensitive to water scarcity and IR than cereal crops. In addition, we found that barley has the smallest daily ETc and IR but the highest increase rate in NIR under climate change, especially in the central part of South Korea. The NIR of Chinese cabbage-fall is the lowest in the northern region and increases moving southwards. The NIR of spinach is projected to increase gradually from the southern and eastern coastlines to the northern inland area. Onions have the largest ETc and NIR of the 29 upland crops, but they show small changes compared to other crops under climate change. Water scarcity is a major limiting factor for sustainable agricultural production. The variation of IR and ETc values for each crop under different climate change scenarios depends on the crop, soil, space, and meteorological characteristics. The results of this study can be used as a guideline for irrigation and soil water management for upland crops under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cAgricultural Research Service (ARS) Research Participation Programdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cBasic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725  cMinistry of Education Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004085  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDOEdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000150 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abarley 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3agrain crops 3aguidelines 3ahighlands 3airrigation requirement 3amodels 3aonions 3aprices 3arain 3asoil water 3aspinach 3asustainable agriculture 3atemperature 3avegetable crops 3aSouth Korea 0aClimate change 0aEvapotranspiration 0aIrrigation requirement 0aSoil moisture model 0aSouth Korea 0aUpland crop1 aNam, Won-HoeauthoruNational Drought Mitigation Center, School of Natural Resources, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9671-65691 aChoi, Jin-YongeauthoruDepartment of Rural Systems Engineering and Research Institute for Agriculture & Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea1 aPachepsky, Yakov A.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, MD, USA0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Feb., v. 165 p.163-180dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774c165e163  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:1446  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6052627759ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00066-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S0378377415301748.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:5262775  a2019-04-03  a2022-10-0406272nab a2200997 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098024004400139035002800183040001800211100011100229245016000340300001800500506002800518506003600546506007600582506003100658520197800689592002802667593001802695596004402713596004502757506003702802650002202839650002802861650002802889650002302917650002602940650001202966650001902978650001902997650002303016650002903039650001303068650001803081650001503099650002303114650001403137650002103151650001503172650001103187650001103198650001203209650001803221650001103239651001903250651001803269653001903287653002103306653002103327653000803348653000703356653002203363653001303385700014503398700014003543700014303683700016003826700011503986700011004101700015204211700015204363773014004515787003304655787001804688787002104706856008804727903002404815912001204839914004604851914003704897916001504934917001104949918003604960935002204996949001505018953007805033954006105111955003505172961002005207974001705227983001505244984001505259991606857590742620221207131159.0190613e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059798782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.1162doi7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.1162chorus  aagid:5979878-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagena, Moges B.eauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA10aImpact of climate change and climate anomalies on hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in an agricultural catchment of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, USA  ap. 1443-1454.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aNutrient export from agricultural landscapes is a water quality concern and the cause of mitigation activities worldwide. Climate change impacts hydrology and nutrient cycling by changing soil moisture, stoichiometric nutrient ratios, and soil temperature, potentially complicating mitigation measures. This research quantifies the impact of climate change and climate anomalies on hydrology, nutrient cycling, and greenhouse gas emissions in an agricultural catchment of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. We force a calibrated model with seven downscaled and bias-corrected regional climate models and derived climate anomalies to assess their impact on hydrology and the export of nitrate (NO3-), phosphorus (P), and sediment, and emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and di-nitrogen (N2). Model-average (±standard deviation) results indicate that climate change, through an increase in precipitation and temperature, will result in substantial increases in winter/spring flow (10.6 ± 12.3%), NO3- (17.3 ± 6.4%), dissolved P (32.3 ± 18.4%), total P (24.8 ± 16.9%), and sediment (25.2 ± 16.6%) export, and a slight increases in N2O (0.3 ± 4.8%) and N2 (0.2 ± 11.8%) emissions. Conversely, decreases in summer flow (−29.1 ± 24.6%) and the export of dissolved P (−15.5 ± 26.4%), total P (−16.3 ± 20.7%), sediment (−20.7 ± 18.3%), and NO3- (−29.1 ± 27.8%) are driven by greater evapotranspiration from increasing summer temperatures. Decreases in N2O (−26.9 ± 15.7%) and N2 (−36.6 ± 22.9%) are predicted in the summer and driven by drier soils. While the changes in flow are related directly to changes in precipitation and temperature, the changes in nutrient and sediment export are, to some extent, driven by changes in agricultural management that climate change induces, such as earlier spring tillage and altered nutrient application timing and by alterations to nutrient cycling in the soil.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural management 3aagricultural watersheds 3aapplication timing 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aevapotranspiration 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anitrates 3anitrous oxide 3aphosphorus 3asediment transport 3asediments 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3atillage 3awater quality 3awinter 3aChesapeake Bay 3aUnited States 0aClimate change 0aGreenhouse gases 0aNutrient cycling 0aN2O 0aN2 0aWeather anomalies 0aSWAT-VSA1 aCollick, Amy S.eauthoruDepartment of Agriculture, Food and Resource Sciences, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD, USA1 aRoss, Andrew C.eauthoruDepartment of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA1 aNajjar, Raymond G.eauthoruDepartment of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA1 aRau, BenjamineauthoruUS Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Center for Forest Watershed Research, Aiken, SC, USA1 aSommerlot, Andrew R.eauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA1 aFuka, Daniel R.eauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA1 aKleinman, Peter J.A.eauthoruUSDA, Agricultural Research Service, Pasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit, University Park, PA, USA1 aEaston, Zachary M.eauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7997-19580 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 637-638 p.1443-1454dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl445540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.1163Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4455b0048-9697c637-638e1443  fScience of the total environment  aBatch:2026  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6059798789ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/12447-00002-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0048969718317595.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARSUSDA/FS  aagid:5979878  a2019-06-13  a2022-10-0403856nab a2200829 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002100098024001700119024002400136024001100160035002600171040001800197100011900215245010400334300001600438506017300454520094900627592002801576593001801604593002001622594002201642593002001664650002001684650002401704650001101728650001901739650001201758650001401770650001301784650002601797650000901823650001501832650000901847650000901856650001301865650001101878650001101889651001801900700002701918700002801945700002601973700002601999700002702025700002802052700002802080773014402108787003302252787001802285787001902303856011202322856007002434912001202504914004102516914004502557916001402602917001102616918004302627935002202670949001502692953002702707956010302734961000902837962003002846962004702876962004702923974001502970983001502985984001503000986001103015991606957860742620221214225010.0160205e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000609472DNAL7 a10113/609472hdl7 a3030622aris7 a10.1890/1402662doi8 ans7395  aagid:60947-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBriske, David DeauthoruDepartment of Ecosystem Science and Management, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX10aClimate‐change adaptation on rangelands: linking regional exposure with diverse adaptive capacity  ap. 249-256.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe ecological consequences of climate change are predicted to vary greatly throughout US rangelands. Projections show warming and drying in the southern Great Plains and the Southwest, warmer and drier summers with reduced winter snowpack in the Northwest, and warmer and wetter conditions in the northern Great Plains. Primarily through their combined effects on soil water availability, these climatic changes will modify plant production and community composition, which will, in turn, affect the livelihoods of humans who rely upon livestock grazing. The ability of rangeland managers to assess risk and prepare for climate change varies greatly and reflects their different adaptive capacities. Geographically specific exposure to climate change and a diverse adaptive capacity to counteract these changes will require development of varied adaptation strategies that can accommodate the various needs and abilities of livestock managers.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article  eARIS manuscript 3aair temperature 3acommunity structure 3adrying 3aglobal warming 3agrazing 3alivestock 3amanagers 3aplant available water 3arain 3arangelands 3arisk 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asummer 3awinter 3aUnited States1 aJoyce, Linda Aeauthor1 aPolley, H Wayneeauthor1 aBrown, Joel Reauthor1 aWolter, Klauseauthor1 aMorgan, Jack Aeauthor1 aMcCarl, Bruce Aeauthor1 aBailey, Derek Weauthor0 tFrontiers in Ecology and the Environment.g2015 June, v. 13, no. 5 p.249-256dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2308340uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/609473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1402663Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:23083b1540-9295c13d5e249  fFrontiers in Ecology and the Environment  aBatch:959  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6000609479ExL  a2015-07-09  a15409295_2015_13_5.xml  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/briske%20et%20al%202015.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:959 reviewed on 2015-07-08T16:00:03Z  aBatch:959 reviewed on 2015-07-09T04:00:06Z  aagid:60947  a2016-02-05  a2016-02-05  ans739504936nab a2200805 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098024003800139035002800177040001800205100018500223245013100408300001600539520188800555592002802443593001802471596003002489596002402519650001602543650002402559650001902583650002302602650002002625650001202645650003502657650001502692650001302707650002102720650001102741650001502752650003502767650001302802650002002815650001402835650001702849650001602866650001602882651001402898653002502912653002402937653002502961653001502986653001303001653001603014700018803030700012703218700012403345773010703469787003303576787001803609787002203627856008503649912001203734914004203746914002803788916001503816917001103831918003603842935002203878949001503900953006003915954006103975955003504036961001204071974001704083983001504100984001504115991606961820742620221123002008.0190215e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060564632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.10.0102chorus7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.10.0102doi  aagid:6056463-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips-Mao, LauraeauthoruDepartment of Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Biology, University of Minnesota, 135 Skok Hall, 2003 Upper Buford Circle, Saint Paul, MN 55108, USA10aModel-based scenario planning to develop climate change adaptation strategies for rare plant populations in grassland reserves  ap. 103-114.  aIncorporating climate change into conservation decision-making at site and population scales is challenging due to uncertainties associated with localized climate change impacts and population responses to multiple interacting impacts and adaptation strategies. We explore the use of spatially explicit population models to facilitate scenario analysis, a conservation planning approach for situations of high uncertainty. We developed dynamic, linked habitat suitability and metapopulation models using RAMAS GIS to consider management and monitoring options for a grassland reserve in Minnesota (USA) in order to support a hydrologically sensitive rare orchid (Cypripedium candidum). We evaluated 54 future scenarios combining changes in drought frequency, increased depth to water table, and multiple configurations of increased invasive species cover and management. Simulation results allowed us to prioritize adaptation strategies and monitoring guidelines to inform adaptive management for our model system. For example, preventing further spread of invasive species into the current C. candidum population is an important low-risk resilience strategy for this site. However, under more serious climate change scenarios, higher-risk strategies, such as protecting critical recharge areas, become essential. Additionally, allocating limited monitoring resources toward detecting changes in depth to water table and assessing C. candidum population responses to severe drought will more efficiently inform decisions about when to shift from low-risk resilience approaches to higher-risk resistance and facilitation strategies. Applying this scenario-based modeling approach to other high-priority populations will enable conservation decision-makers to develop sound, cost-effective, site-specific management and monitoring protocols despite the uncertainties of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNorthern Research Station  cU.S. Forest Service 3aCypripedium 3aadaptive management 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3adrought 3ageographic information systems 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anatural resources conservation 3aplanning 3aplants (botany) 3aprotocols 3arare species 3auncertainty 3awater table 3aMinnesota 0aCypripedium candidum 0aHabitat suitability 0aMetapopulation model 0aMonitoring 0aInvasion 0aRare plants1 aGalatowitsch, Susan M.eauthoruDepartment of Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Biology, University of Minnesota, 135 Skok Hall, 2003 Upper Buford Circle, Saint Paul, MN 55108, USA1 aSnyder, Stephanie A.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, 1992 Folwell Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55108, USA1 aHaight, Robert G.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, 1992 Folwell Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55108, USA0 tBiological conservation.g2016 Jan., v. 193 p.103-114dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4460740uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44607b0006-3207c193e103  fBiological conservation  aBatch:2050  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6060564639ExL  a2019-02-15  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/46-2-00002-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S000632071530135X.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6056463  a2019-02-15  a2022-09-0205191nab a2200829 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002100098024003300119024001100152035002600163040001800189100003100207245010800238300001300346506017300359520237100532593001802903593002002921650001302941650001902954650002202973650001202995650001903007650001903026650002303045650001003068650001503078650002503093650001303118650001403131650002103145650000903166650002003175650002303195650001803218650001603236650001403252650001903266650001303285650002403298651001203322651001703334651002703351651001703378700003203395700002903427773010803456787003303564787001803597787003003615787001903645856011203664856004603776912001203822914002703834914004403861917001103905935002203916949001503938956010103953961000904054962003004063962004804093962004704141974001504188983001504203984001504218985011704233986001104350991607013000742620221120033102.0130709e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006802762DNAL7 a10113/570332hdl7 a10.3996/032011-JFWM-0202doi8 ans2364  aagid:57033-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoesch, Charles R.eauthor13aAn Assessment of Re-Directing Breeding Waterfowl Conservation Relative to Predictions of Climate Change  ap. 1-22.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a long history of habitat conservation in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of the United States that has focused on migratory birds, particularly waterfowl. The ongoing acquisition program of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System has conserved approximately 1.1 million hectares of critical breeding waterfowl habitat. Results of recent predicted future climate scenarios are being used to suggest that waterfowl conservation be shifted away from currently important areas in the western and central portions of the U.S. PPR eastward, to locations where wetland and climate models suggest may become more conducive for providing wetland habitat for breeding ducks in the future. We used 24 years of breeding waterfowl and wetland monitoring data collected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System in the PPR of North and South Dakota and northeast Montana, along with land value and restoration cost data to conduct an economic assessment of the biological risk of refocusing waterfowl conservation efforts eastward due to recent projections of climate change. We considered the immediate risk of the loss of existing wetland and grassland resources in the western portion of the U.S. PPR, their current carrying capacity and production potential, the financial cost of protection vs. restoration relative to current conservation priorities, and the uncertainty of climate change effects on waterfowl habitat distribution. Because unprotected wetland and grassland habitats exist in the western and central portions of the PPR that are important for maintaining current waterfowl carrying capacity and productivity, and climate change effects are highly uncertain, maintaining the current focus of habitat protection appears to be the most cost effective approach for waterfowl habitat conservation efforts. Additionally, continued intensive monitoring activities designed to detect changing waterfowl populations and upland and wetland habitat as they relate to anthropogenic impacts (e.g., pattern tile drainage, grassland conversion) and climatic changes (e.g., wetland hydro-period), should provide more precise results to inform and adapt management and conservation activities accordingly should spatial and temporal changes in wet-dry cycles occur in the future.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3acarrying capacity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aconservation areas 3aducks 3agrasslands 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3aland restoration 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atemporal variation 3atile drainage 3auncertainty 3awaterfowl 3awet-dry cycles 3awetlands 3awildlife management 3aMontana 3aNorth Dakota 3aPrairie Pothole region 3aSouth Dakota1 aReynolds, Ronald E.eauthor1 aHansen, LeRoy T.eauthor0 tJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management.g2012 June, v. 3, no. 1 p.1-22wJournal:28326x1944-687X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)2832640uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/570333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3996/032011-JFWM-020  aArticle  aJournal:28326c3d1e1  fJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management  aissued  aIND5006802769ExL  a2013-08-14  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Loesch_JFWM-June-2012.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:303 annotated on 2013-08-06T15:12:48Z  aBatch:303 reviewed on 2013-08-14T14:00:02Z  aagid:57033  a2013-07-09  a2016-08-16  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.XXX 2012/012/28)  ans236404654nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098024002200133024001900155035002800174040001800202100020200220245012000422300001000542506007600552520168700628592002802315593001802343596006502361506003702426650001702463650002002480650001902500650001102519650001502530650001502545650002002560650001102580650001102591650001102602650002202613651001502635700016802650700011502818700010002933700017503033700009003208773012503298787003303423787001803456787002403474856008203498912001203580914004403592914002103636916001503657917001103672918002903683935002203712949001503734953006703749954005603816955003703872961001203909974001703921983001503938984001503953991607165790742620221207134458.0200424e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058664212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-017-0557-92doi7 aPMC58549522pmcid7 a295561182pmid  aagid:5866421-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFullerton, A.

Predictions of impacts typically do not account for fine-grained spatiotemporal thermal patterns in rivers. Patches of cooler water could serve as refuges for anadromous species like salmon that migrate during summer. We used high-resolution remotely sensed water temperature data to characterize summer thermal heterogeneity patterns for 11,308 km of second–seventh-order rivers throughout the Pacific Northwest and northern California (USA). We evaluated (1) water temperature patterns at different spatial resolutions, (2) the frequency, size, and spacing of cool thermal patches suitable for Pacific salmon (i.e., contiguous stretches ≥ 0.25 km, ≤ 15 °C and ≥ 2 °C, aooler than adjacent water), and (3) potential influences of climate change on availability of cool patches. Thermal heterogeneity was nonlinearly related to the spatial resolution of water temperature data, and heterogeneity at fine resolution (< 1 km) would have been difficult to quantify without spatially continuous data. Cool patches were generally > 2.7 and < 13.0 km long, and spacing among patches was generally > 5.7 and < 49.4 km. Thermal heterogeneity varied among rivers, some of which had long uninterrupted stretches of warm water ≥ 20 °C, and others had many smaller cool patches. Our models predicted little change in future thermal heterogeneity among rivers, but within-river patterns sometimes changed markedly compared to contemporary patterns. These results can inform long-term monitoring programs as well as near-term climate-adaptation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aF14AC00600cNorth Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOncorhynchus 3aanadromous fish 3aclimate change 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3arefuge habitats 3arivers 3asalmon 3asummer 3awater temperature 3aCalifornia1 aTorgersen, C.

We analyzed the potential effects of climate change on 200 plant species in Puerto Rico under two emission scenarios and in four periods over the twenty-first century. Our approach was based on ensemble bioclimatic modeling using eight modeling algorithms and community richness analysis. Our findings showed that the probabilities of environmental suitability decline for wet climate species and increase for drier and warm climate species in the future periods under both emission scenarios, with stronger effects under the higher emission scenario. Expansion of dry climate species to higher elevations appears to be a prominent response of species to climatic change in the island based on changes in environmental suitability but the actual species redistribution will be influenced by their life histories, potential adaptation, dispersal abilities, species introductions, and species interactions. This potential movement leads to a spatial pattern of species richness at site level that shows a positive relationship with elevation, which becomes stronger in the later periods of the century. The spatial pattern of species richness, if combined with single species projections, can provide critical information for conservation management in the island. Conservation management can support island-wide biological diversity by protecting the wet climate species on the uplands.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a16-JV-11120101-012 MOD01cUSDA Caribbean Climate Hub 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3adry climates 3ahighlands 3aintroduced species 3aislands 3alife history 3amodels 3aspecies richness 3aPuerto Rico1 aGould, William A.eauthoruInternational Institute of Tropical Forestry, USDA Forest Service, San Juan, PR, USA1 aFalkowski, Michael J.eauthoruNatural Resource Ecology Laboratory, Colorado State University, 1499 Campus Delivery, Fort Collins, CO, 80523, USA1 aMuscarella, RoberteauthoruDepartment of Bioscience - Ecoinformatics and Biodiversity, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark1 aUriarte, MaríaeauthoruDepartment of Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA1 aYousef, FoadeauthoruFoad Yousef, Department of Biology, Westminster College, Salt Lake City, UT, USA0 tClimatic change.g2019 Sept., v. 156, no. 1-2 p.15-30dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02491-w3Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c156d1-2e15  fClimatic change  aBatch:2359  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6067241529ExL  a2020-01-22  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_20-02-06_06-03-53.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-156-1-2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6724152  a2020-02-07  a2020-02-0705155nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100024200180245013900422300001400561520161800575592002802193593001802221596005002239650001802289650001102307650001702318650001902335650000902354650003302363650002402396650002302420650001202443650001102455650002902466650001102495650002702506650001602533650001502549651001002564700025602574700014802830700024102978700023703219700013903456700020203595773011403797787003303911787001803944787002103962856008303983912001204066914004504078914002004123916001504143917001104158918002904169935002204198949001504220953006704235954005904302955003704361961001204398974001704410983001504427984001504442991607209990742620221120232902.0200207e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067241652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02524-42doi  aagid:6724165-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, DechengeauthoruJoint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change (ILCEC)/Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Agricultural Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210044, China10aPotential impacts of climate change on vegetation dynamics and ecosystem function in a mountain watershed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau  ap. 31-50.  aThe Qinghai-Tibet Plateau constitutes unique mountain ecosystems that can be used for early detection of the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functions. We use the MAPSS-CENTURY 2 (MC2), a dynamic global vegetation model, to examine the potential responses of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change in the past (1961–2010) and future (2011–2080) under one medium-low warming scenario (RCP4.5) at a 1-km spatial resolution in the Upper Heihe River Basin (UHRB), northwestern China. Results showed that 21.4% of the watershed area has experienced changes in potential natural vegetation types in the past and that 42.6% of the land would undergo changes by the 2070s, characterized by a sharp increase in alpine tundra at the cost of cold barren land. Net primary productivity (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (RH) have increased sharply since the mid-1980s and are projected to remain at reduced rates in the future. Overall, UHRB switched from carbon neutral to a carbon sink in 1961–2010, and the sink strength is projected to decline after 2040. Additionally, future climate change is projected to drive a decrease in water yield due to a slight decrease in precipitation and an increase in evapotranspiration (ET). Furthermore, we find large spatial variations in simulated ecosystem dynamics, including an upward trend of NPP, RH, and ET in the alpine zone, but a downward trend in the mid-elevation forest zone. These results underscore the complexity of potential impacts of climate change on mountain watersheds that represent the headwaters of inland river systems in an arid environment.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a91425301cNatural Science Foundation of China 3aalpine tundra 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3acold 3adry environmental conditions 3aecological function 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3amodels 3anet primary productivity 3arivers 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awater yield 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aHao, LueauthoruJoint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change (ILCEC)/Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Agricultural Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210044, China. haolu@nuist.edu.cn1 aKim, John B.eauthoruPacific Northwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Corvallis, OR, 97331, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3720-79161 aLiu, PeilongeauthoruJoint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change (ILCEC)/Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Agricultural Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210044, China1 aPan, CeneauthoruJoint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change (ILCEC)/Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Agricultural Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210044, China1 aLiu, YongqiangeauthoruCenters for Forest Disturbance Science, Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Athens, GA, 30602, USA1 aSun, GeeauthoruEastern Forest Environmental Threat Assessment Center, Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27709, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3665-33130 tClimatic change.g2019 Sept., v. 156, no. 1-2 p.31-50dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02524-43Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c156d1-2e31  fClimatic change  aBatch:2359  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6067241659ExL  a2020-01-22  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_20-02-06_06-03-53.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-156-1-2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6724165  a2020-02-07  a2020-02-0705711nab a2200961 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002300115024003000138024001200168035002800180040001800208100025600226245014400482300001600626506017300642520193000815592002802745593001802773595006202791593002002853650002502873650002502898650001902923650001802942650003002960650001302990650001903003650001903022650002003041650001803061650002203079650001403101650001603115650003203131650001303163650002703176650002603203650000903229650001603238650001003254650002003264650001603284650001903300650001603319650001503335650001003350653002203360653001803382653001503400653001803415653001903433700012603452700015103578773013403729787003303863787001803896787002403914856011403938856007704052912001204129914003404141914002804175916001504203917001104218918005104229935002204280949001504302953006204317954005504379955003404434956008404468961001304552962003004565962004704595962004804642974001704690983001504707984001504722986001204737991607279830742620221214231448.0200226e20161102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058521712DNAL7 a3266122aris7 a10113/58521712hdl7 a10.3920/WMJ2016.20532doi8 ans13413  aagid:5852171-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaughan, M.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Mycotoxin Prevention and Applied Microbiology Unit, National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, 1815 North University Street, Peoria, IL 61604, USA10aClimate change impacts on the ecology of Fusarium graminearum species complex and susceptibility of wheat to Fusarium head blight: a review  ap. 685-700.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aFusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat, caused mainly by a few members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC), is a major threat to agricultural grain production, food safety, and animal health. The severity of disease epidemics and accumulation of associated trichothecene mycotoxins in wheat kernels is strongly driven by meteorological factors. The potential impacts of change in climate are reviewed from the perspective of the FGSC life cycle and host resistance mechanisms influenced by abiotic pressures at the ecological, physiological and molecular level. Alterations in climate patterns and cropping systems may affect the distribution, composition and load of FGSC inoculum, but quantitative information is lacking regarding the differential responses among FGSC members. In general, the coincidence of wet and warm environment during flowering enhances the risk of FHB epidemics, but the magnitude and direction of the change in FHB and mycotoxin risk will be a consequence of a multitude of effects on key processes affecting inoculum dynamics and host susceptibility. Rates of residue decomposition, inoculum production and dispersal may be significantly altered by changes in crop rotations, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO₂]), temperature and precipitation patterns, but the impact may be much greater for regions where inoculum is more limited, such as temperate climates. In regions of non-limiting inoculum, climate change effects will likely be greater on the pathogenic rather than on the saprophytic phase. Although the mechanisms by which abiotic stress influences wheat defences against Fusarium species are unknown, available data would suggest that wheat may be more susceptible to Fusarium infection under future climate conditions. Additional research in this area should be a priority so that breeding efforts and climate resilient management strategies can be developed.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a1534bksichelmanc2017-11-15dmanager-lgarnere2017-11-16  eARIS manuscript 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aabiotic stress 3aanimal health 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abreeding 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3acrop rotation 3adisease outbreaks 3aflowering 3afood safety 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ainoculum 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aresistance mechanisms 3arisk 3asaprophytes 3aseeds 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3atrichothecenes 3awarm season 3awet season 3awheat 0aTriticum aestivum 0aglobal change 0awheat scab 0atrichothecene 0adeoxynivalenol1 aBackhouse, D.eauthoruSchool of Environmental and Rural Science, University of New England, Armidale NSW 2351, Australia1 aPonte, E.M.

Shifts of LSP have cascading effects on food production, carbon sequestration, water consumption, biodiversity, and public health. Previous studies mainly focused on investigating the effects of urbanization on the spatial patterns of LSP by comparing phenological metrics, e.g. start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS), between urban center and the surrounding rural regions. However, it remains unclear how urbanization-induced land cover conversions and climate change jointly influence the temporal variations of SOS and EOS within the urban ecosystem. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized daily two-band enhanced vegetation index, daily meteorological record, and annual land cover dataset to investigate the respective impacts of urbanization and climate change on temporal shifts of LSP between the post- and the pre-urbanization periods over 196 large cities in the northern mid-latitudes. We found 51% of the cities experienced an advanced SOS with an average of −6.39 ± 5.82 days after urbanization has occurred, while the remaining 49% of the cities had a delayed SOS with an average of 7.56 ± 5.63 days. We also found a later EOS at 53% of the cities and an earlier EOS at 47% of the cities with an average of 8.43 ± 7.59 and −5.57 ± 4.99 days between the post- and pre-urbanization periods, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis indicates that climate variables (i.e. temperature, precipitation, and insolation) play dominant roles in regulating the temporal shifts of LSP. Furthermore, the earlier SOS and later EOS were significantly correlated with the amplitude of urbanization (i.e. increase of impervious surface area) in cities after controlling for effects of climate factors. These patterns were generally consistent across eight climate zones. Our findings provide critical information in modeling natural and anthropogenic effects on urban ecosystem, with important benefits for urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNASAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000104  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006959  cUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hilldhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000078900 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3acarbon sequestration 3acities 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aclimatic zones 3afood production 3aland cover 3alatitude 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aphenology 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3arural areas 3asolar radiation 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3avegetation index 0aLand surface phenology 0aClimate change 0aUrbanization 0aTwo-band enhanced vegetation index1 aSong, CongheeauthoruDepartment of Geography, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA1 aZhang, YulongeauthoruDepartment of Geography, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA1 aLiu, HongshengeauthoruDepartment of Statistics and Operations Research, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA1 aVose, James M.eauthoruCenter for Integrated Forest Science, USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27709, USA0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Jan., v. 236 p.111477-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1173540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.1114773Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aArticle  aJournal:11735b0034-4257  fRemote sensing of environment  aBatch:2391  aBatch:2393  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6067481599ExL  a2020-01-08  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/880379657093315729-00002-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0034425719304961.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6748159  a2020-03-18  a2022-10-0403795nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024001700121024004200138035002800180040001800208100004800226245004700274300001400321506017300335520102700508592002801535593001801563595005201581593002001633650001301653650001901666650001901685650002001704650002001724650001501744650001901759650001101778650000901789650001301798650001601811650002001827651001501847700007601862700007501938700006902013700007102082773012402153787003302277787001802310787001902328856011402347856005502461912001202516914004102528914005702569916001502626917001102641918003702652935002202689949001502711956008502726961000902811962003002820962004802850974001702898983001502915984001502930985011602945986001203061991607428270742620221214225025.0180228e20140203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059278372DNAL7 a10113/59278372hdl7 a2870252aris7 a10.1111/j.1936-704X.2013.03154.x2doi  aagid:5927837-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRango, AlberteauthoruUSDA, Las Cruces, NM10aAcequias and the Effects of Climate Change  ap. 84-94.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aTraditional forms of acequia irrigation can be combined with ground based and remote sensing snow measurements and snowmelt runoff modeling to better estimate runoff volumes now and in the future under conditions of climate change. The experience gained over 400 years of irrigating small fields strongly binds communities and strengthens the resolve of acequia associations to contest challenges presented by climate change. Increased density of snow measurements in high elevations of the Rio Grande along with input of real-time data to snowmelt models has led to an improved potential for acequia decision making under the increased temperatures projected for the future by climate models. Acequia communities and similar Native American settlements have shown the willingness to share water during times of severe water shortages in the southwestern U.S. Acequia associations have shown the desire to adopt new forms of hydrologic data and modeling techniques and incorporate them into acequia association approaches.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  bllucasc2018-04-24dmanager-lgarnere2018-04-24  eARIS manuscript 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adecision making 3ahydrologic data 3airrigation 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3atemperature 3awater shortages 3aNew Mexico1 aFernald, AlexandereauthoruNew Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM1 aSteele, CaitrianaeauthoruNew Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM1 aHurd, BrianeauthoruNew Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM1 aOchoa, CarloseauthoruNew Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM0 tJournal of contemporary water research and education.g2013 Aug., v. 151, no. 1 p.84-94wJournal:21516x1936-704X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2151640uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/59278373Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1936-704X.2013.03154.x  aArticle  aJournal:21516b1936-704Xc151d1e84  fJournal of contemporary water research and education  aBatch:2328  aissued2 aUSDA submissionseprovider5DNAL  aIND6059278379ExL  a2021-06-22  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/13-042.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:2328 reviewed on 2019-10-18T11:00:03Z  aagid:5927837  a2018-02-28  a2020-09-10  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans1398106626nab a2200805 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100019100180245008100371300001000452520222400462592002802686593001802714650001402732650001202746650001202758650001902770650002302789650001102812650001502823650002002838650001202858650001102870650001902881700011402900700010603014700009903120700006603219700015003285700010803435700007403543700010903617700010803726700013903834700008903973700011904062700008104181700012204262700012404384700014104508700010704649700008404756700007304840700012304913700012705036773011005163787003305273787001805306787002105324856008305345912001205428914004405440914002005484916001605504917001105520918002905531935002205560949001505582953006705597954005905664955003705723961001305760974001705773983001505790984001505805991607432100742620221121172836.0220831e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077633442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-022-03336-92doi  aagid:7763344-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRose, Steven K.eauthoruEnergy Systems and Climate Analysis Research Group, Electric Power Research Institute, Washington, DC, USA. srose@epri.com1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0682-856510aGlobal biomass supply modeling for long-run management of the climate system  ap. 3.  aBioenergy is projected to have a prominent, valuable, and maybe essential, role in climate management. However, there is significant variation in projected bioenergy deployment results, as well as concerns about the potential environmental and social implications of supplying biomass. Bioenergy deployment projections are market equilibrium solutions from integrated modeling, yet little is known about the underlying modeling of the supply of biomass as a feedstock for energy use in these modeling frameworks. We undertake a novel diagnostic analysis with ten global models to elucidate, compare, and assess how biomass is supplied within the models used to inform long-run climate management. With experiments that isolate and reveal biomass supply modeling behavior and characteristics (costs, emissions, land use, market effects), we learn about biomass supply tendencies and differences. The insights provide a new level of modeling transparency and understanding of estimated global biomass supplies that informs evaluation of the potential for bioenergy in managing the climate and interpretation of integrated modeling. For each model, we characterize the potential distributions of global biomass supply across regions and feedstock types for increasing levels of quantity supplied, as well as some of the potential societal externalities of supplying biomass. We also evaluate the biomass supply implications of managing these externalities. Finally, we interpret biomass market results from integrated modeling in terms of our new understanding of biomass supply. Overall, we find little consensus between models on where biomass could be cost-effectively produced and the implications. We also reveal model specific biomass supply narratives, with results providing new insights into integrated modeling bioenergy outcomes and differences. The analysis finds that many integrated models are considering and managing emissions and land use externalities of supplying biomass and estimating that environmental and societal trade-offs in the form of land emissions, land conversion, and higher agricultural prices are cost-effective, and to some degree a reality of using biomass, to address climate change.  aPublisher supplied data

Crop productivity is primarily determined by a combination of temperature and precipitation because temperatures have to be in the range for plant growth and precipitation has to supply crop water requirements for a given environment. The question is often asked about the changes in productivity and what we can expect in the future and we evaluated the causes for variation in historical annual statewide wheat grain yields in Oklahoma, Kansas, and North Dakota across the Great Plains of United States. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is adapted to this area and we focused on production in these states from 1950 to 2016. This analysis used a framework for annual yields using yield gaps between attainable and actual yields and found the primary cause of the variation among years were attributable to inadequate precipitation during the grain-filling period. In Oklahoma, wheat yields were reduced when April and May precipitation was limited (r2 D 0.70), while in Kansas, May precipitation was the dominant factor (r2 D 0.78), and in North Dakota June–July precipitation was the factor explaining yield variation (r2 D 0.65). Temperature varied among seasons and at the statewide level did not explain a significant portion of the yield variation. The pattern of increased variation in precipitation will cause further variation in wheat production across the Great Plains. Reducing yield variation among years will require adaptation practices that increase water availability to the crop coupled with the positive impact derived from other management practices, e.g., cultivars, fertilizer management, etc.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  baallenc2018-04-18dmanager-lgarnere2018-04-200 fUnrestricted online access2star  eARIS manuscript 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagroclimatology 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3afertilizers 3afilling period 3agrain yield 3aplant growth 3arain 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3awater requirement 3awheat 3aGreat Plains region 3aKansas 3aNorth Dakota 3aOklahoma1 aDold, ChristianeauthoruSupervisory Plant Physiologist and Research Associate, National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Ames, IA, United States0 tFrontiers in plant science.g2018 Feb. 20, v. 9 p.224-wJournal:2199x1664-462X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)219940uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/59278093Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2018.002243Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:2199b1664-462Xc9e224  fFrontiers in plant science  aBatch:2328  aissued2 aUSDA submissionseprovider5DNAL  aIND6059278099ExL  a2021-06-22  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/nal%20338876%20Hatfield%20agroclimatology%20and%20wheat%202018.pdf  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/338876%20Hatfield%20Dold%202018%20agroclimatology%20MS.pdf  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Hatfield%20and%20Dold%202018%20Frontiers%20doi%2010.3389%20fpls.2018.00224.pdf  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission, eISSN 1664-462x  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:2328 reviewed on 2019-10-18T11:00:03Z  aagid:5927809  a2018-04-04  a2020-10-01  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans1410904050nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003900121024004200160035002800202040001800230100007600248245012400324520138900448592002801837593001801865596000901883650001601892650001801908650001101926650001901937650001601956650001201972650001301984650002301997650002102020650001602041650001802057650000902075650001902084650002502103650001502128651002302143651001302166700008102179700007802260700010002338700010102438773009002539787003302629787001802662856011402680856008502794912001202879914003602891916001602927917001102943918002702954935002202981949001503003955003403018961000903052962003003061962004703091974001703138979003403155983003003189984001503219985010603234991607800470742620221123000813.0220901e20200602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076803292DNAL7 a10113/76803292hdl7 a10.1080/10549811.2020.17688722doi7 a10.1080/10549811.2020.17688722chorus  aagid:7680329-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSena, KentoneauthoruLewis Honors College, University of Kentucky, USA10aClimate Change and Invasive Species: Challenges and Opportunities for Forest Establishment on Appalachian Surface Mines  aClimate change and harsh environmental conditions present significant barriers to the reforestation of surface-mined sites in Appalachia. An experimental site was established on a reclaimed surface mine in eastern Kentucky to investigate the impacts of soil amendments (fertilizer additions and mycorrhizal inoculations) on the growth and survival of northern red oak and loblolly pine, and the effects of amendments and species planted on soil development. While early effects of soil fertility and mycorrhizae treatments were apparent, these did not affect the growth or survival of either species after 10 growing seasons. Overall, loblolly pine exhibited greater growth (7.6 m) and survival (58%) than northern red oak (1.8 m height growth and 39% survival). While the poor growth and survival of northern red oak were attributed to heavy vegetative competition from nonnative species, loblolly pine rapidly achieved canopy closure and shaded out competitive understory vegetation. This study documents that non-native loblolly pine may serve as an important pioneering tree species in reforestation of reclaimed mine sites by potentially outcompeting invasive exotic understory plant species. We speculate that, by suppressing invasive species, loblolly pine may have the potential to serve as a “nurse tree” for more economically and ecologically desirable hardwood species.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA 3aPinus taeda 3aQuercus rubra 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3afertilizers 3aforests 3ahardwood 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3amycorrhizae 3areforestation 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asustainable forestry 3aunderstory 3aAppalachian region 3aKentucky1 aMetzmeier, JoshuaeauthoruLewis Honors College, University of Kentucky, USA1 aSmith, BrandoneauthoruLewis Honors College, University of Kentucky, USA1 aHansen, BetheauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Natural Resources, University of Kentucky, USA1 aBarton Chris,eauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Natural Resources, University of Kentucky, USA0 tJournal of Sustainable Forestry.g2020 June 02, dInforma UK Limitedx1540-756x7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/76803293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2020.17688723Available from publisher's site  aArticle  fJournal of Sustainable Forestry  aBatch:10239  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6076803299ExL  a2022-04-19  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1540-756x  aagid:7680329  aArticle missing volume number  a2022-09-01T12:45:42-04:00  a2022-09-14  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl05661nab a2200853 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024001700121024003000138035002800168040001800196100012900214245009000343300001800433506017300451520139100624593001802015593002002033595005602053593002002109650002102129650003102150650002302181650001702204650001702221650001902238650002302257650002202280650001902302650002102321650002002342650002102362650001502383650002302398650003902421650002202460650001702482700010902499700013802608700012202746700013702868700014703005700013103152700011403283700014203397700011503539700010503654700014703759700010903906773009604015787003304111787001804144787001904162856011104181856004304292912001204335914004204347914002604389916001604415917001104431935002204442949001504464952001504479956008304494961000904577962004604586974001704632983001504649984001504664985011604679986001204795991608252990742620221214231438.0180723e20160905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067571972DNAL7 a10113/67571972hdl7 a3415332aris7 a10.1038/nclimate31142doi  aagid:6757197-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovick, Kimberly A.eauthoruIndiana University, School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Bloomington, Indiana 47405, USA14aThe increasing importance of atmospheric demand for ecosystem water and carbon fluxes  ap. 1023-1027.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aSoil moisture supply and atmospheric demand for water independently limit—and profoundly aect—vegetation productivity and water use during periods of hydrologic stress1–4. Disentangling the impact of these two drivers on ecosystem carbon and water cycling is dicult because they are often correlated, and experimental tools for manipulating atmospheric demand in the field are lacking. Consequently, the role of atmospheric demand is often not adequately factored into experiments or represented in models5–7. Here we show that atmospheric demand limits surface conductance and evapotranspiration to a greater extent than soil moisture in many biomes, including mesic forests that are of particular importance to the terrestrial carbon sink8,9. Further, using projections from ten general circulation models, we show that climate change will increase the importance of atmospheric constraints to carbon and water fluxes in all ecosystems. Consequently, atmospheric demand will become increasingly important for vegetation function, accounting for >70% of growing season limitation to surface conductance in mesic temperate forests. Our results suggest that failure to consider the limiting role of atmospheric demand in experimental designs, simulation models and land management strategies will lead to incorrect projections of ecosystem responses to future climate conditions.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  a434balice.allenc2020-02-28damanda.xue2020-03-06  eARIS manuscript 3aEarth atmosphere 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest ecosystems 3agrowing season 3ahydrologic cycle 3aland management 3amesic conditions 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil-plant-atmosphere interactions 3atemperate forests 3awater stress1 aFicklin, Darren L.eauthoruDepartment of Geography, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47405, USA1 aStoy, Paul C.eauthoruDepartment of Land Resources and Environmental Sciences, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana 59717, USA1 aWilliams, Christopher A.eauthoruClark University, Graduate School of Geography, Worcester, Massachusetts 01610, USA1 aBohrer, GileauthoruDepartment of Civil, The Ohio State University, Environmental & Geodetic Engineering, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA1 aOishi, A. ChristophereauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, Otto, North Carolina 28763, USA1 aPapuga, Shirley A.eauthoruUniversity of Arizona, School of Natural Resources and the Environment, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA1 aBlanken, Peter D.eauthoruDepartment of Geography, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0260, USA1 aNoormets, AskoeauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Natural Resources, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, USA1 aSulman, Benjamin N.eauthoruDepartment of Geosciences, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA1 aScott, Russell L.eauthoruSouthwest Watershed Research Center, USDA-ARS, Tucson, Arizona 85719, USA1 aWang, LixineauthoruDepartment of Earth Sciences, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA1 aPhillips, Richard P.eauthoruDepartment of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47405, USA0 tNature climate change.g2016 Nov., v. 6, no. 11 p.1023-1027wJournal:27227x1758-67987nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2722740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate31143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate3114  aArticle  aJournal:27227b1758-6798c6d11e1023  fNature climate change  aBatch:10159  aissued  aIND6067571979ExL  a2021-10-14  dgolden set  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2371.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission;eISSN 1758-6798  aagid:6757197  a2018-07-23  a2021-10-14  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans1499704726nab a2200769 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100015800180245010200338300001800440520162800458592002802086593001802114650003002132650001702162650001702179650001202196650001902208650001002227650001202237650001502249650002502264650001102289650002102300650001302321650001302334650000902347650002502356650001202381650001602393650001602409650001802425650001702443650001002460651001202470700011302482700013402595700010602729700013302835700010602968700012203074700010103196773011503297787003303412787001803445787002103463856008303484912001203567914004503579914002003624916001503644917001103659918002903670935002203699949001503721953006703736954005703803955003703860961001203897974001703909983001503926984001503941991608436450742620221120065528.0220112e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072251102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02617-02doi  aagid:7225110-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReynolds, Heather LeauthoruDepartment of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA. hlreynol@indiana.edu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1827-140X10aImplications of climate change for managing urban green infrastructure: an Indiana, US case study  ap. 1967-1984.  aUrban areas around the world are increasingly investing in networks of urban forests, gardens, and other forms of green infrastructure for their benefits, including enhanced livability, sustainability, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Proactive planning for climate change requires anticipating potential climate change impacts to green infrastructure and adjusting management strategies accordingly. We apply climate change projections for the Midwest US state of Indiana to assess the possible impacts of climate change on common forms of urban green infrastructure and identify management implications. Projected changes in Indiana’s temperature and precipitation could pose numerous management challenges for urban green infrastructure, including water stress, pests, weeds, disease, invasive species, flooding, frost risk, and timing of maintenance. Meeting these challenges will involve managing for key characteristics of resilient systems (e.g., biodiversity, redundancy) as well as more specific strategies addressing particular climate changes (e.g., shifting species compositions, building soil water holding capacity). Climate change also presents opportunities to promote urban green infrastructure. Unlike human built infrastructure, green infrastructure is conducive to grassroots stewardship and governance, relieving climate change-related strains on municipal budgets. Resources for adapting urban green infrastructure to climate change are already being applied to the management of urban green infrastructure, and emerging research will enhance understanding of best management practices.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abest management practices 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afrost 3agardens 3agovernance 3agreen infrastructure 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3aplanning 3aresearch 3arisk 3asoil water retention 3astrains 3atemperature 3aurban areas 3aurban forests 3awater stress 3aweeds 3aIndiana1 aBrandt, LeslieeauthoruNorthern Institute of Applied Climate Science, USDA Forest Service, St Paul, MN, USA1 aFischer, Burnell CeauthoruO’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA), Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA1 aHardiman, Brady SeauthoruForestry and Natural Resources, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA1 aMoxley, Donovan JeauthoruO’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA), Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA1 aSandweiss, EriceauthoruEnvironmental Resilience Institute, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA1 aSpeer, James HeauthoruDepartment of Earth and Environmental Systems, Indiana State University, Terra Haute, IN, USA1 aFei, SonglineauthoruForestry and Natural Resources, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA0 tClimatic change.g2020 Dec., v. 163, no. 4 p.1967-1984dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02617-03Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c163d4e1967  fClimatic change  aBatch:2644  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6072251109ExL  a2021-03-01  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_22-01-11_05-27-53.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-163-4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7225110  a2022-01-12  a2022-01-1206161nab a2200925 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100015700180245008000337300001800417520215600435592002802591593001802619596006802637596006802705596002102773650002402794650000902818650001102827650001202838650001902850650002702869650001302896650002302909650002302932650001502955650002302970650001102993650001503004650001203019650001103031650001603042650001503058650002003073650001503093650002503108650001003133650001303143650001403156650001503170650001303185650001503198650002303213650002303236650002303259650002203282650001403304700018303318700016103501700012903662700012103791700017903912700015304091700013404244700019604378773011504574787003304689787001804722787002104740856008304761912001204844914004504856914002004901916001504921917001104936918002904947935002204976949001504998953006705013954005705080955003705137961001405174974001705188983001505205984001505220991608462190742620221121200736.0220112e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072250882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-020-02915-y2doi  aagid:7225088-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOjima, Dennis S.eauthoruNatural Resources Ecology Laboratory, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80523-1499, USA. Dennis.Ojima@colostate.edu12aA climate change indicator framework for rangelands and pastures of the USA  ap. 1733-1750.  aRangelands and pastures include grasslands, savannas, shrublands, and woodlands and are often maintained to support grazing animals. Rangelands and pastures cover more than one-third of the land area in the USA and a similar extent globally. The ecosystem goods and services associated with rangeland and pastureland include critical wildlife habitat, forage for livestock, amenities related to water conservation, sustainable soil functions, and soil stabilization and support a diversity of biota and livelihoods. This paper provides a framework for development of a socio-ecological system (SES)–oriented set of indicators for rangeland and pasture systems to support evaluation of impacts of climate and land use changes. These indicators will also serve to inform adaptive management practices. We present a rationale for using an SES approach to evaluate trends and vulnerabilities of rangeland and pasture systems and provide an example of a set of system indicators arising from the SES approach. The indicators include evaporative demand, land cover extent, aboveground plant biomass, human demographics (population age distribution), cattle numbers, and economic value of cattle products relative to total agricultural value. These indicators are not meant to be comprehensive but are offered to illustrate how they might be used in a SES approach to plan for, assess, and mitigate climate change impacts. The conceptual framework provides a systems perspective on the impact of climate change on the socio-ecological dynamics of rangeland and pasture systems including measures of the resilience and vulnerability of ecosystem services with respect to the six indicators. The article focusses on livestock production in rangeland ecosystems, recognizing that additional work is needed to address pastures and other ecosystem services. Examples of the types of regional information associated with the indicators are provided. Guidance for future efforts in indicator development is offered.

Pathways of Hg accumulation and loss in forest soils include throughfall, litterfall, soil gas fluxes, and leaching in soil solution, all of which will likely be altered under changing climate. We took advantage of three ongoing climate-change manipulation experiments at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA: a combined growing-season warming and winter freeze-thaw cycle experiment, a throughfall exclusion to mimic drought, and a simulated ice storm experiment to examine the response of the forest Hg cycle to climatic disturbances. Across these three experiments, we compared Hg inputs in throughfall and leaf litterfall and Hg outputs in soil gas fluxes. Soil solution was measured only in the simulated ice storm experiment. We found that northern forest soils retained consistently less Hg by 16–60% in the three climate manipulations compared to the undisturbed controls (~ 7.4 µg Hg m⁻² year⁻¹), although soils across all three experiments still served as a net sink for Hg. Growing-season soil warming and combined soil warming and winter freeze-thaw cycles had little effect on litterfall and throughfall flux, but they increased soil Hg⁰ evasion by 31 and 35%, respectively, relative to the control plots. The drought plots had 5% lower litterfall Hg flux, 50% lower throughfall Hg flux, and 21% lower soil Hg⁰ evasion than the control plots. The simulated ice storm had 23% higher litterfall Hg flux, 1% higher throughfall Hg flux, 37% higher soil Hg⁰ evasion, and 151% higher soil Hg leaching than the control plots. These observations suggest that climate changes such as warmer soils in the growing season or more intense ice storms in winter are likely to exacerbate Hg pollution by releasing Hg sequestered in forest soils via evasion and leaching.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a1149929cNational Science Foundation  a1637685cNational Science Foundation  a1457675cNational Science Foundation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aforest soils 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agrowing season 3ahardwood forests 3aice 3aleaching 3aleaves 3amercury 3aneurotoxicity 3aplant litter 3apollutants 3apollution 3asoil air 3asoil heating 3asoil solution 3astorms 3athroughfall 3awinter 3aNew Hampshire1 aMeng, LinghuieauthoruDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA. limeng@syr.edu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3188-7818 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3188-78181 aYanai, Ruth D.eauthoruDepartment of Forest and Natural Resources Management, State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, NY, 13210, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6987-2489 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6987-24891 aMontesdeoca, MarioeauthoruDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA1 aTempler, Pamela H.eauthoruDepartment of Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA, 02215, USA1 aAsbjornsen, HeidieauthoruDepartment of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, 03824, USA1 aRustad, Lindsey E.eauthoruNorthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Durham, NH, 03824, USA1 aDriscoll, Charles T.eauthoruDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2692-2890 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2692-28900 tBiogeochemistry.g2019 Nov., v. 146, no. 1 p.1-16dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl3602840uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-019-00605-13Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl36028b0168-2563c146d1e1  fBiogeochemistry  aBatch:2418  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6067511809ExL  a2020-03-05  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_19-11-19_05-52-10.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10533-146-1.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2418 reviewed on 2020-03-04T12:00:11Z  aBatch:2418 reviewed on 2020-03-05T16:00:03Z  aagid:6751180  a2019-11-19  a2020-03-0504863nab a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100022700180245012200407300001200529520250000541592002803041593001803069650001103087650002503098650001903123650002303142650002303165650001503188650002203203650001203225650001103237650001203248650001103260650001003271650001603281650001403297650001303311651001103324651001103335651001003346651001303356651001003369700015303379773011203532787003303644787001803677787001803695856008303713912001203796914004003808914002903848916001603877917001103893918002903904935002203933949001503955953006703970954005604037955003704093961001204130974001704142983001504159984001504174991608539110742620221121025616.0220318e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075985862DNAL7 a10.1007/s13595-021-01115-72doi  aagid:7598586-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacheco, Renata MartinseauthoruINESC TEC and Faculdade de Engenharia, Universidade do Porto, Campus da FEUP, Rua Dr. Roberto Frias, 4200-465, Porto, Portugal. renatapacheco@fe.up.pt1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1259-361910aPrescribed burning as a cost-effective way to address climate change and forest management in Mediterranean countries  ap. 100.  aKEY MESSAGE : As climate change and forest management become the focus of various development agendas and the price of carbon rises in the market, the need for improving carbon sequestration and avoiding wildfires emissions increases. Prescribed burning interventions might play an important role in this context, as in some situations, it has been suggested that it can reduce overall fire emissions. In this study, the potential economic benefits associated with the practice are analyzed for five Mediterranean countries. Despite the uncertainty in the estimates, the results suggest that under some circumstances these interventions can be cost-effective from a carbon management perspective. CONTEXT: Wildland fires are becoming a major concern for many European countries and are expected to become more prevalent due to climate change, affecting societies, ecosystems, and various ecosystem services provided by forests that are not valued by traditional markets, such as carbon sequestration. AIMS: The objective of this study is to evaluate the possibility of using carbon taxation to fund fire management measures in Mediterranean countries. METHODS: The analysis is done by converting prescribed burning savings in carbon emissions into their economic value. This is performed for France, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, which is studied in more detail, since the country has a National Prescribed Burning Program (NPBP) and a specific tax on carbon in place. RESULTS: The results indicate that most countries could potentially have benefits in the order of millions of euros from employing prescribed burning measures. In Portugal, NPBP has the potential to be a relevant policy instrument to reduce wildfire emissions, as well as economically since the carbon emissions savings can outweigh the prescribed burning costs in some circumstances. Also, the revenue from the country’s Addition Tax on Carbon Emissions would be able to accommodate the foreseen prescribed burning costs. CONCLUSION: There are still many uncertainties regarding the benefits of prescribed burning in terms of overall emission reductions, and more studies should be conducted on this topic. However, as the price of carbon rises in the markets and climate change becomes a more pressing concern, even small emissions reductions might be economically interesting. The analysis framework used in this study has the potential to be useful for other countries, especially in Mediterranean-type ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystems 3aforest management 3aforests 3aincome 3amarkets 3aprices 3ataxes 3auncertainty 3awildfires 3awildland 3aFrance 3aGreece 3aItaly 3aPortugal 3aSpain1 aClaro, JoãoeauthoruINESC TEC and Faculdade de Engenharia, Universidade do Porto, Campus da FEUP, Rua Dr. Roberto Frias, 4200-465, Porto, Portugal0 tAnnals of forest science.g2021 Dec., v. 78, no. 4 p.100-100dSpringer PariswJournal:2137x1286-45607nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)213740uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-021-01115-73Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:2137b1286-4560c78d4e100  fAnnals of forest science  aBatch:10223  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6075985869ExL  a2022-02-23  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_22-03-18_05-27-14.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/13595-78-4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/DA  aagid:7598586  a2022-03-18  a2022-03-1802731nab a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100015700180245009500337300001800432500002200450592002800472700018300500700016100683700012900844700012100973700017801094700015301272700013401425700019601559773009801755787003301853856008301886912001201969914002001981917001102001918002902012935002202041953006702063954005702130955003702187961001402224974001702238983001502255984001502270991608550190742620221122004848.0211214e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075985232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-020-02948-32doi  aagid:7598523-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOjima, Dennis S.eauthoruNatural Resources Ecology Laboratory, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80523-1499, USA.

For the eastern United States, I compared the timing of tree change, comprised of density and diversity increases, with the timing of climate change, as measured by change point detection of the Palmer Modified Drought Index (PMDI) that accounts for water balance, in two prairie ecological provinces, four grassland landscapes, and four forest landscapes. Historical evidence supplied documentation of tree density increases between approximately 1860 and 1890 in the two prairie provinces of grasslands bordering eastern forests. Additionally, because timing of tree increases paralleled when land area reached ≥25% agricultural use, I categorized grassland and forest landscapes that increased to ≥25% agricultural area during 1860, 1880, 1900, and 1920. One change point detection method identified no significant PMDI change points during the 1800s. The other method found the southern prairie province, bordering eastern forests, had change points of 1855 and 1865 during an interval of relative dryness. Only two of four grassland landscapes, and one of four forest landscapes had change points, which occurred during relative dryness or were continuous with historical variation. Inconsistent changes in moisture availability did not provide correlations with comprehensive tree increases, but land use change corresponded with tree changes based on timing, magnitude and direction of change, and mechanism. The agricultural threshold may provide the critical missing component that allows progression in analysis of land use change effects on vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aland 3aland use change 3atrees0 tLand.g2021 Oct. 22, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2155540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land101111213Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:21555b2073-445Xc10d11  fLand  aBatch:10210  aissued2 aMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing Instituteeprovider5DNAL  aIND6075779019ExL  a2022-02-23  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/mdpinstitute/land-v10-i11-20211125.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/land-v10-i11-20211125.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7577901  a2021-11-25  a2022-02-1905638nab a2200865 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004400098035002800142040001800170100015100188245005700339300001500396520286300411592002803274593001803302650004303320650002003363650001203383650001903395650002703414650001603441650001803457650001803475650001403493650001303507650001203520650002203532650002103554650002303575650001203598650001203610650002103622650002603643650002303669650002203692650001403714650001503728650001803743650000903761650001903770650001903789650002403808650002203832650001803854650001703872650001503889650003203904650002303936650002703959650001703986651001804003700009704021700007804118773009704196787003304293787001804326787002204344856009004366912001204456914004104468914002504509916001504534917001104549918003404560935002204594949001504616953003304631961001304664962004804677974001704725983001504742984001504757991608622390742620221121100628.0150809s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011172722DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-407685-3.00002-52doi  aagid:1117272-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado, Jorge A.eauthoruUSDA ARS Soil Plant Nutrient Research Unit, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.

Several publications have reported that over the last few decades, rainfall intensities have increased in many parts of the world, including in the United States. Without good, productive soils and the ecosystem services provided by them, the survival of our species will be in jeopardy. The future changes in climate that will drive erosion processes will significantly impact soil erosion rates, with higher projected erosion rates for the United States. These higher erosion rates will significantly contribute to lower soil productivity, lower soil organic matter content, lower soil quality, and higher rates of nutrient loss that will contribute to a reduction in the inherent soil fertility that is so important for maintaining viable economic systems and sustainability. These same hydrological changes will also include the occurrence of occasional droughts, and for some regions, such as the southwestern United States, projections suggest that there will be a decrease in precipitation and a drier region, which will have negative effects on plant productivity and increase the potential for wind erosion. Farmer management adaptations and use of conservation practices to adapt to a changing climate (e.g., no-till practices, crop rotations, precision conservation, crop selection and dates of planting, harvest, and tillage) have the potential to greatly reduce soil erosion rates. Conservation practices will be key and must be used as strategies for adaptation to climate change impacts on the soil resource. Examples of key strategies are the use of conservation tillage, management of crop rotations and crop residue (including use of cover crops where viable), management of livestock grazing intensities, improved management of irrigation systems, use of technologies, and precision conservation. Many other conservation practices also have the potential to reduce much or all of the potential acceleration of soil erosion rates that may occur under a change in climate that will bring more total rainfall with higher intensity rainfall events, or a change to a drier climate that will potentially bring higher wind erosion rates. One important adaptation practice will be to consider projected spatial changes in the hydrological cycle, such as wetter and drier regions, and periods of drought. This could help in the development and/or implementation of soil and water conservation policies that consider temporal and spatial effects from climate change at the regional level. These policies should also consider conservation practices that contribute to increased water-holding capacity in the soil profile, improved drainage practices, and the development of new crop varieties and cropping systems that are more resistant to drought.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aNatural Resources Conservation Service 3aadverse effects 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconservation practices 3acover crops 3acrop residues 3acrop rotation 3acultivars 3adrainage 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aeconomic systems 3aecosystem services 3afarmers 3agrazing 3ahydrologic cycle 3airrigation management 3airrigation systems 3aissues and policy 3alivestock 3ano-tillage 3aplanting date 3arain 3arain intensity 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic matter 3asoil productivity 3asoil profiles 3asoil quality 3asoil water 3asustainable land management 3awater conservation 3awater holding capacity 3awind erosion 3aUnited States1 aNearing, Mark A.eauthoruUSDA ARS Southwest Watershed Research Center, Tucson, Arizona, USA1 aRice, Charles W.eauthoruKansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA0 tAdvances in agronomy.g2013, v. 121 p.47-115dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-21137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4942140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-407685-3.00002-53Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl49421b0065-2113c121e47  fAdvances in agronomy  aBatch:1251  aissued2 aElsevier B.V.eprovider5DNAL  aIND6011172729ExL  a2016-04-07  aNAL26470006521130121000C.xml  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:1251 reviewed on 2016-04-07T12:00:02Z  aagid:1117272  a2015-08-09  a2016-04-0704778nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098035002800139040001800167100014100185245012400326500001900450520165800469592002802127593001802155650002202173650002102195650001902216650001202235650001902247650001202266650001602278650002102294650000902315650001502324650002202339650002502361650000902386650001002395651001302405653001502418653001302433653003302446700018502479700014502664700014602809700014702955700014203102700009503244773013403339787003303473787001803506787002103524856008803545912001203633914003903645914003703684916001603721917001103737918003603748935002203784949001503806953009103821954006103912955003503973961001304008974001704021983001504038984001504053991608661260742620221121050704.0210201e20200820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069254362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1390942doi  aagid:6925436-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraya, A.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, 2004 Throckmorton Plant Science Center, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, United States10aSpatial analysis of the impact of climate change factors and adaptation strategies on productivity of wheat in Ethiopia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWheat production is expected to be challenged by future climate change. However, it is unclear how wheat grown in diverse agroecologies will respond to climate change and adaptation management strategies. A geospatial simulation study was conducted to understand the impacts of climate change and adaptation management strategies on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in Ethiopia. Simulation results showed that the average long-term baseline (1980–2005) wheat yield ranged from 1593 to 3356 kg/ha. This wheat yield range is within the national average (2100–2700 kg/ha) for this decade. In regions with cooler temperatures (<21 °C), mid-century temperatures and elevated CO₂, along with increased N fertilizer slightly improved attainable yield levels above 3000 kg/ha. Whereas, in regions with heat and drought conditions wheat yield declined regardless the increase of N or CO₂ levels. Wheat yield increased at a diminishing rate with increase in N fertilizer rate. However, N fertilizer did not increase yields under low rainfall conditions. Two to five irrigation per season contributed to yield improvement for low rainfall locations, while yield did not substantially improve for locations receiving adequate seasonal rainfall. Therefore, based on this study, improved N fertilizer application in combination with increased CO₂ could improve wheat yield under future climate in most wheat producing regions (with adequate rainfall) of Ethiopia. Our results provide valuable information regarding impacts of climate change factors and adaptation strategies for producers, researchers, extension professionals and policy makers.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aTriticum aestivum 3aattainable yield 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aenvironment 3afertilizer rates 3aheat 3airrigation 3aissues and policy 3anitrogen fertilizers 3arain 3awheat 3aEthiopia 0aCrop model 0aNitrogen 0aCarbon dioxide concentration1 aPrasad, P.V.V.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, 2004 Throckmorton Plant Science Center, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, United States1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6632-33611 aZambreski, Z.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, 2004 Throckmorton Plant Science Center, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, United States1 aGowda, P.H.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service, Southeast Area, Stoneville, MS, United States1 aCiampitti, I.A.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, 2004 Throckmorton Plant Science Center, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, United States1 aAssefa, Y.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, 2004 Throckmorton Plant Science Center, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, United States1 aGirma, A.eauthoruMekelle University, Institute of Climate and Society, Mekelle, Ethiopia0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Aug. 20, v. 731 p.139094-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl445540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1390943Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4455b0048-9697e139094  fScience of the total environment  aBatch:10126  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6069254369ExL  a2021-08-26  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/753237420489071479-00001-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0048969720326115.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6925436  a2021-02-01  a2021-08-2603986nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098024003000125035002800155040001800183100016200201245011500363300001800478520165200496592002802148593001802176650002002194650001202214650001902226650002002245650001502265650002002280650000902300650001402309650001802323650001302341650001802354650002402372650001202396650002302408650002202431651001802453700002902471700003102500700002002531700003102551700003002582700002602612700002702638773009202665787003302757787001802790787002402808856007302832912001202905914004702917914002702964916001402991917001103005918004303016935002203059949001503081953002703096961001203123962004703135962004703182974001703229983001503246984001503261991608693900742620221120165058.0150513e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013295822DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.103582doi7 a10.1002/hyp.103582chorus  aagid:1329582-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaldwell, PetereauthoruCoweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, Center for Forest Watershed Science, USDA Forest Service, 3160 Coweeta Lab Road, Otto, NC, 28763, USA10aShort‐term stream water temperature observations permit rapid assessment of potential climate change impacts  ap. 2196-2211.  aAssessment of potential climate change impacts on stream water temperature (Tₛ) across large scales remains challenging for resource managers because energy exchange processes between the atmosphere and the stream environment are complex and uncertain, and few long‐term datasets are available to evaluate changes over time. In this study, we demonstrate how simple monthly linear regression models based on short‐term historical Tₛobservations and readily available interpolated air temperature (Tₐ) estimates can be used for rapid assessment of historical and future changes in Tₛ. Models were developed for 61 sites in the southeastern USA using ≥18 months of observations and were validated at sites with longer periods of record. The Tₛmodels were then used to estimate temporal changes in Tₛat each site using both historical estimates and future Tₐprojections. Results suggested that the linear regression models adequately explained the variability in Tₛacross sites, and the relationships between Tₛand Tₐremained consistent over 37 years. We estimated that most sites had increases in historical annual mean Tₛbetween 1961 and 2010 (mean of +0.11 °C decade⁻¹). All 61 sites were projected to experience increases in Tₛfrom 2011 to 2060 under the three climate projections evaluated (mean of +0.41 °C decade⁻¹). Several of the sites with the largest historical and future Tₛchanges were located in ecoregions home to temperature‐sensitive fish species. This methodology can be used by resource managers for rapid assessment of potential climate change impacts on stream water temperature.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aecoregions 3aenergy transfer 3afish 3ahydrology 3alinear models 3amanagers 3arapid methods 3aregression analysis 3astreams 3atemporal variation 3awater temperature 3aUnited States1 aSegura, Catalinaeauthor1 aGull Laird, Shelbyeauthor1 aSun, Geeauthor1 aMcNulty, Steven G.eauthor1 aSandercock, Mariaeauthor1 aBoggs, Johnnyeauthor1 aVose, James M.eauthor0 tHydrological processes.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 29, no. 9 p.2196-2211dWileyx0885-60877nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl393846640uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.103583Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3938466b0885-6087c29d9e2196  fHydrological processes  aBatch:933  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6013295829ExL  a2020-03-06  a08856087_2015_29_9.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:933 reviewed on 2015-06-29T11:00:02Z  aBatch:933 reviewed on 2015-06-29T16:00:03Z  aagid:1329582  a2015-05-13  a2020-03-0603467nab a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003400121024003700155035002800192040001800220100001100238245011400249506007600363506003100439520136500470592002801835593001801863596004201881596004701923506003701970650003002007650001902037650002302056650002402079650001602103700001102119700001102130773006902141787003302210787001802243856011402261856008102375912001202456914003502468917001102503918002702514935002202541949001502563952001902578955003402597961000902631962003002640962004702670974001702717979003402734984001502768985010602783991608781440742620221215142843.0221002e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073452292DNAL7 a10113/73452292hdl7 a10.1088/1748-9326/aa6eb22doi7 a10.1088/1748-9326/aa6eb22chorus  aagid:7345229-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 eauthor10aEconomic impacts of climate change on agriculture: a comparison of process-based and statistical yield models  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aA large number of studies have been published examining the implications of climate change for agricultural productivity that, broadly speaking, can be divided into process-based modeling and statistical approaches. Despite a general perception that results from these methods differ substantially, there have been few direct comparisons. Here we use a data-base of yield impact studies compiled for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (Porter et al 2014) to systematically compare results from process-based and empirical studies. Controlling for differences in representation of CO2 fertilization between the two methods, we find little evidence for differences in the yield response to warming. The magnitude of CO2 fertilization is instead a much larger source of uncertainty. Based on this set of impact results, we find a very limited potential for on-farm adaptation to reduce yield impacts. We use the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) global economic model to estimate welfare consequences of yield changes and find negligible welfare changes for warming of 1 °C–2 °C if CO2 fertilization is included and large negative effects on welfare without CO2. Uncertainty bounds on welfare changes are highly asymmetric, showing substantial probability of large declines in welfare for warming of 2 °C–3 °C even including the CO2 fertilization effect.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cBiological and Environmental Research  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural productivity 3aclimate change 3aeconometric models 3ainternational trade 3auncertainty1 eauthor1 eauthor0 tEnvironmental Research Letters.dIOP Publishingx1748-93267nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73452293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6eb23Available from publisher's site  aArticle  fEnvironmental Research Letters  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073452299ExL  a2022-04-21  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1478-9329  aagid:7345229  aArticle missing volume number  a2022-10-04  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl03221nab a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003900121024004200160035002800202040001800230100003000248245013200278520120400410592002801614593001801642596005201660650002601712650002401738650001201762651003101774700003001805700002901835773008501864787003301949787001801982787001902000856011402019856008602133912001202219914003002231914003202261917001102293918002702304935002202331949001502353952001902368955003402387961000902421962003002430962004702460974001702507979003402524984001502558985010602573991608810770742620221117162903.0220901e20160902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073451312DNAL7 a10113/73451312hdl7 a10.1080/17524032.2016.11769472doi7 a10.1080/17524032.2016.11769472chorus  aagid:7345131-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowers, Alison W.eauthor10aClimate change communication insights from cooperative Extension professionals in the US Southern states: finding common ground  aClimate change is often avoided in educational programming due to its perceived polarizing nature. Identifying areas of agreement may help educators introduce climate change topics and help audiences begin to listen. As part of a survey of Extension professionals in the southeastern US, respondents shared their thoughts about climate change. Based on methods used by Maibach, Leiserowitz, Roser-Renouf, and Mertz [(2011). Identifying like-minded audiences for global warming public engagement campaigns: An audience segmentation analysis and tool development. PLoS ONE, 6(3), e17571], we categorized respondents using the Six Americas segments. Qualitative data analysis techniques were applied to identify common themes. Five themes emerged as common across most segments: (1) confusion and mistrust abound, (2) educators face barriers to climate change education, (3) economic aspects of climate change are important, (4) we should be good stewards of Earth, and (5) adaptation is an agreeable strategy. By identifying climate change message frames with which people may agree, regardless of how they feel about climate change, educators may be able to better communicate with broader audiences.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture 3acitizen participation 3aextension education 3asurveys 3aSoutheastern United States1 aMonroe, Martha C.eauthor1 aAdams, Damian C.eauthor0 tEnvironmental Communication.dInforma UK LimitedwJournal:11640x1752-40327nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1164040uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73451313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17524032.2016.11769473Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:11640c10d5e656  fEnvironmental Communication  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073451319ExL  a2022-04-21  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1752-4040  aagid:7345131  aArticle missing volume number  a2022-09-06  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl05046nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003000098024002700128024003400155035002800189040001800217100011300235245010800348500002000456506002800476506003000504520192900534592002802463593001802491596004502509506003702554650001102591650001702602650001902619650001302638650002002651650002202671650001202693650001302705650001202718650001502730650001102745650001402756650000902770650002202779650001902801650000902820651001402829700015302843700015802996700015603154700011203310700014003422773010503562787003303667787001803700787001903718856007303737903002203810912001203832914004303844914001403887916001503901917001103916918004303927935002203970949001503992953005604007954006004063955003404123961001204157962004804169974001704217983001504234984001504249991609036190742620221207123152.0180730e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060725272DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.22932chorus7 a10.1002/ecs2.22932doi7 a10.1002/ecs2.22932chorusOpen  aagid:6072527-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucash, Melissa S.eauthoruDepartment of Geography, Portland State University, Portland, Oregon, 97201, USA10aMore than the sum of its parts: how disturbance interactions shape forest dynamics under climate change  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aInteractions among disturbances are seldom quantified, and how they will be affected by climate change is even more uncertain. In this study, we sought to better understand how interactions among disturbances shift under climate change by applying a process‐based landscape disturbance and succession model (LANDIS‐II) to project disturbance regimes under climate change in north‐central Minnesota, USA. Specifically, we (1) contrasted mortality rates and the extent of disturbance for four individual (single) disturbance regimes (fire, insects, wind, or forest management) vs. all four disturbance regimes operating simultaneously (concurrent) under multiple climate change scenarios and (2) determined how climate change interacts with single and concurrent disturbance regimes to affect carbon stocks and forest composition. Under single disturbance regimes, we found that climate change amplifies mortality, but did not substantially change the overall extent of disturbances. Tree mortality under the concurrent disturbance regime scenario was less than the sum of all single disturbance regimes, providing evidence of significant negative feedbacks among disturbances, particularly under climate change. Finally, we found that climate change was the most critical driver of area harvested (via shifts in species composition), soil carbon, species composition, and diversity, while the disturbance regime (i.e., single or concurrent) had a larger influence on aboveground carbon and the relative dominance of conifers vs. hardwoods. In conclusion, our simulations suggest that disturbance interactions will be strongly mediated by climate change and will produce increasingly negative feedbacks, preventing worst‐case disturbance outcomes. Our results underscore the importance of running simulations with multiple disturbances on the landscape concurrently rather than focusing on any one or two disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data

Distribution and Abundance of the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) With Special Reference to North America and Europe  ap. 1212-1224.  aThe invasive brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stål; Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), has recently emerged as a harmful pest of horticultural crops in North America and Europe. Native to East Asia, this highly polyphagous insect is spreading rapidly worldwide. Climate change will add further complications to managing this species in terms of both geographic distribution and population growth. This study used CLIMEX to compare potential H. halys distribution under recent and future climate models using one emission scenario (A2) with two different global circulation models, CSIRO Mk3.0 and MIROC-H. Simulated changes in seasonal phenology and voltinism were examined. Under the possible future climate scenarios, suitable range in Europe expands northward. In North America, the suitable H. halys range shifts northward into Canada and contracts from its southern temperature range limits in the United States due to increased heat stress. Prolonged periods of warm temperatures resulted in longer H. halys growing seasons. However, future climate scenarios indicated that rising summer temperatures decrease H. halys growth potential compared to recent climatic conditions, which in turn, may reduce mid-summer crop damage. Climate change may increase the number of H. halys generations produced annually, thereby enabling the invasive insect to become multivoltine in the northern latitudes of North America and Europe where it is currently reported to be univoltine. These results indicate prime horticultural production areas in Europe, the northeastern United States, and southeastern Canada are at greatest risk from H. halys under both current and possible future climates.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aHalyomorpha halys 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3acrop damage 3ageographical distribution 3agrowing season 3aheat stress 3ahorticultural crops 3ahorticulture 3ainsects 3ainvasive species 3alatitude 3amultivoltine habit 3aphenology 3apopulation growth 3arisk 3asummer 3atemperature 3aunivoltine habit 3aCanada 3aEast Asia 3aEurope 3aNortheastern United States 0aCLIMEX 0avoltinism0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2017 Dec. 08, v. 46, no. 6 p.1212-1224dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl3243x1938-29367nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl324340uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvx1573Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3243b1938-2936c46d6e1212  fEnvironmental entomology  aBatch:2294  aissued2 aOxford University Presseprovider5DNAL  aIND6065503229ExL  a2019-09-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/oxford/ee46.tar.gz  afile:/data/metadata/staging/oxford/nvx157.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/oxford/  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:2294 reviewed on 2019-09-06T14:00:04Z  aagid:6550322  a2019-07-29  a2020-01-0205111nab a2200769 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098024003000125035002800155040001800183100012900201245010900330300001800439500002000457506002800477506003000505520226700535592002802802593001802830596008902848596004502937596004602982506003703028650002003065650001203085650001103097650001903108650002103127650002303148650002103171650001803192650001703210650001803227650001303245650001103258650001103269650001603280650001003296651001003306700009103316700009803407700009703505773012303602787003303725787001803758787002203776856007303798903002203871912001203893914004503905914002603950916001503976917001103991918004304002935002204045949001504067953005704082954006104139955003404200961001204234962004804246974001704294983001504311984001504326991610062700742620221207135012.0180704e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060090772DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.141202doi7 a10.1111/gcb.141202chorus  aagid:6009077-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeets, AaroneauthoruSchool of Forest Resources, University of Maine, Orono, ME, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1498-658X10aQuantifying climate–growth relationships at the stand level in a mature mixed‐species conifer forest  ap. 3587-3602.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aA range of environmental factors regulate tree growth; however, climate is generally thought to most strongly influence year‐to‐year variability in growth. Numerous dendrochronological (tree‐ring) studies have identified climate factors that influence year‐to‐year variability in growth for given tree species and location. However, traditional dendrochronology methods have limitations that prevent them from adequately assessing stand‐level (as opposed to species‐level) growth. We argue that stand‐level growth analyses provide a more meaningful assessment of forest response to climate fluctuations, as well as the management options that may be employed to sustain forest productivity. Working in a mature, mixed‐species stand at the Howland Research Forest of central Maine, USA, we used two alternatives to traditional dendrochronological analyses by (1) selecting trees for coring using a stratified (by size and species), random sampling method that ensures a representative sample of the stand, and (2) converting ring widths to biomass increments, which once summed, produced a representation of stand‐level growth, while maintaining species identities or canopy position if needed. We then tested the relative influence of seasonal climate variables on year‐to‐year variability in the biomass increment using generalized least squares regression, while accounting for temporal autocorrelation. Our results indicate that stand‐level growth responded most strongly to previous summer and current spring climate variables, resulting from a combination of individualistic climate responses occurring at the species‐ and canopy‐position level. Our climate models were better fit to stand‐level biomass increment than to species‐level or canopy‐position summaries. The relative growth responses (i.e., percent change) predicted from the most influential climate variables indicate stand‐level growth varies less from to year‐to‐year than species‐level or canopy‐position growth responses. By assessing stand‐level growth response to climate, we provide an alternative perspective on climate–growth relationships of forests, improving our understanding of forest growth dynamics under a fluctuating climate.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cMaine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Stationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011131  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDOEdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000150 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautocorrelation 3abiomass 3acanopy 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3aconiferous forests 3adendrochronology 3aforest growth 3agrowth rings 3aleast squares 3asampling 3aspring 3asummer 3atree growth 3atrees 3aMaine1 aFraver, ShawneauthoruSchool of Forest Resources, University of Maine, Orono, ME, USA1 aWeiskittel, Aaron R.eauthoruSchool of Forest Resources, University of Maine, Orono, ME, USA1 aHollinger, David Y.eauthoruNorthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Durham, NH, USA0 tGlobal change biology.g2018 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.3587-3602dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.141203Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c24d8e3587  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:2027  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6060090779ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13541013_2018_24_8.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13541013_2018_24_8.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2027 reviewed on 2018-08-03T04:00:02Z  aagid:6009077  a2018-07-04  a2020-03-0604444nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004100097035002700138040001800165100011400183245011300297300001800410520172300428592002802151593001802179650003002197650001202227650001902239650002502258650001402283650002902297650001602326650001602342650001102358650002202369650001702391650002302408650001602431650001802447650001602465650002502481650001302506651001302519700023002532700011502762700018002877773011503057787003303172787001803205787002203223856008703245912001203332914004703344914004003391917001103431918003403442935002103476949001503497953003303512961001303545962004803558962004703606962004703653974001603700983001503716984001503731986001203746991610126730742620221120222031.0150810e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446072882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2011.05.0102doi  aagid:559853-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, X.-C.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Grazinglands Research Laboratory, 7207W.

Compared with the present climate, overall t-tests (n=12) show that it is almost certain that mean precipitation will decline by some 6% (>98.5% probability), daily precipitation variance increase by 12% (>99%), and maximum and minimum temperature increase by 1.46 and 1.26°C (>99%), respectively. Compared with the present climate under the same tillage systems, it is very likely (>90%) that evapotranpiration and long-term soil water storage will decease, but runoff and soil loss will increase despite the projected declines in precipitation. There will be no significant changes in wheat grain yield. Paired t-tests show that daily precipitation variance projected under GGa is greater than those under A2 and B2 (P=0.1), resulting in greater runoff and soil loss under GGa (P=0.1). HadCM3 projected greater mean annual precipitation than CGCM2 and CSIRO (P=0.1). Consequently, greater runoff, grain yield, transpiration, soil evaporation, and soil water storage were simulated for HadCM3 (P=0.1). The inconsistency among GCMs and differential impact responses between emission scenarios underscore the necessity of using multi-GCMs and multi-emission scenarios for impact assessments. Overall results show that no-till and conservation tillage systems will need to be adopted for better soil and water conservation and environmental protection in the region during the next several decades.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconservation tillage 3aemissions 3aenvironmental protection 3aevaporation 3agrain yield 3arunoff 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion 3asoil water storage 3atemperature 3atranspiration 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3avariance 3aOklahoma1 aLiu, W.-Z.eauthoruState Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on Loess Plateau, Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Northwest A & F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China1 aLi, Z.eauthoruCollege of Resource and Environment, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China1 aChen, J.eauthoruDepartment of Construction Engineering, École de technologie supérieure, Université du Québec, 1100 Notre-Dame Street West, Montreal, QC H3 C 1K3, Canada0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 151, no. 10 p.1297-1304dElsevier B.V.x0168-19237nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4325040uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2011.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl43250b0168-1923c151d10e1297  fAgricultural and forest meteorology  aissued2 aElsevier B.V.eprovider5DNAL  aIND446072889ExL  a2013-05-30  aNAL265000168192301510010.xml  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:217 annotated on 2013-05-14T09:04:49Z  aBatch:217 reviewed on 2013-05-30T15:00:02Z  aBatch:217 reviewed on 2013-05-30T16:00:02Z  aagid:559853  a2015-08-10  a2015-08-10  a460728804391nab a2200829 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002600098024001700124024002100141024002700162024001100189035002600200040001800226100003200244245012000276300001600396506017300412520138800585593001801973593002001991593002002011650002402031650002002055650003002075650001702105650001902122650001902141650002102160650001402181650002402195650001502219650002302234650002302257650000902280650001602289700002502305700003102330700003102361700002702392700003002419700002802449700003202477700002802509700002802537700002902565773009302594787003302687787001802720787003002738787002402768856011202792856004002904912001202944914003502956914002002991917001103011935002203022949001503044956014803059961000903207962003003216962004803246962004703294962004703341974001503388983001503403984001503418985011703433986001103550991610453940742620221214223500.0131212e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007172992DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid7 a2834872aris7 a10113/581782hdl7 a10.1111/ele.120172doi8 ans3710  aagid:58178-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSorte, Cascade J.B.eauthor10aPoised to prosper?

To date, the hypothesis that climate change will favor non-native species has been examined though local comparisons of single or few species. We took a meta-analytical approach to examine whether non-native species are poised to outperform native species in future climatic conditions. We compiled a database of studies in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that recorded performance measures of non-native (157 species) and co-occurring native species (204 species) under different temperature, CO2, and precipitation conditions. Our analyses revealed that in terrestrial systems, native and non-native species responded similarly to environmental changes. However, in aquatic systems, increases in temperature and CO2 primarily inhibited native species. There was a general trend towards stronger responses among non-native species, including stronger positive responses to more favorable conditions as well as enhanced negative responses to less favorable conditions. As climate change proceeds, aquatic systems may be particularly vulnerable to invasion. Across systems, there could be a higher risk of invasion at sites becoming more climatically hospitable, while sites shifting towards harsher conditions may become more resistant to invasions.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  eARIS manuscript 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic habitat 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abiodiversity 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adatabases 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3arisk 3atemperature1 aIbanez, Ineseauthor1 aBlumenthal, Dana Meauthor1 aMolinari, Nicole Aeauthor1 aMiller, Luke Peauthor1 aGrosholz, Edwin Deauthor1 aDiez, Jeffrey Meauthor1 aD'Antonio, Carla M.eauthor1 aOlden, Julian Deauthor1 aJones, Sierra Jeauthor1 aDukes, Jeffrey Seauthor0 tEcology letters.g2013 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.261-270wJournal:jnl3774062x1461-02487nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl377406240uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/581783Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12017  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3774062c16d2e261  fEcology letters  aissued  aIND5007172999ExL  a2014-01-30  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Sorte%20et%20al%202013%20-%20Ecol%20Lett%20-%20Poised%20to%20prosper.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:420 annotated on 2014-01-14T07:01:27Z  aBatch:420 reviewed on 2014-01-29T16:00:03Z  aBatch:420 reviewed on 2014-01-30T11:00:03Z  aagid:58178  a2013-12-12  a2014-01-08  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.XXX 2012/012/28)  ans371004716nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100014600171245013000317300001800447500002000465520210400485592002802589593001802617596004602635650001502681650001202696650001902708650002002727650002702747650001502774650001902789650002002808650001502828651002202843700015902865700011103024700012203135700011103257773012403368787003303492787001803525787002203543856007303565912001203638914004603650914002603696916001503722917001103737918004303748935002203791949001503813953005803828954006203886955003403948961001303982962004803995974001704043983001504060984001504075991610521750742620221121234715.0190910e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066434232DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.147242doi  aagid:6643423-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrie, Matthew D.eauthoruSchool of Life Sciences, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5532-882910aDiffering climate and landscape effects on regional dryland vegetation responses during wet periods allude to future patterns  ap. 3305-3318.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDryland vegetation is influenced by biotic and abiotic land surface template (LST) conditions and precipitation (PPT), such that enhanced vegetation responses to periods of high PPT may be shaped by multiple factors. High PPT stochasticity in the Chihuahuan Desert suggests that enhanced responses across broad geographic areas are improbable. Yet, multiyear wet periods may homogenize PPT patterns, interact with favorable LST conditions, and in this way produce enhanced responses. In contrast, periods containing multiple extreme high PPT pulse events could overwhelm LST influences, suggesting a divergence in how climate change could influence vegetation by altering PPT periods. Using a suite of stacked remote sensing and LST datasets from the 1980s to the present, we evaluated PPT‐LST‐Vegetation relationships across this region and tested the hypothesis that enhanced vegetation responses would be initiated by high PPT, but that LST favorability would underlie response magnitude, producing geographic differences between wet periods. We focused on two multiyear wet periods; one of above average, regionally distributed PPT (1990–1993) and a second with locally distributed PPT that contained two extreme wet pulses (2006–2008). 1990–1993 had regional vegetation responses that were correlated with soil properties. 2006–2008 had higher vegetation responses over a smaller area that were correlated primarily with PPT and secondarily to soil properties. Within the overlapping PPT area of both periods, enhanced vegetation responses occurred in similar locations. Thus, LST favorability underlied the geographic pattern of vegetation responses, whereas PPT initiated the response and controlled response area and maximum response magnitude. Multiyear periods provide foresight on the differing impacts that directional changes in mean climate and changes in extreme PPT pulses could have in drylands. Our study shows that future vegetation responses during wet periods will be tied to LST favorability, yet will be shaped by the pattern and magnitude of multiyear PPT events.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aDEB 12-35828cNational Science Foundation 3aarid lands 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ageographical variation 3alandscapes 3aremote sensing 3asoil properties 3avegetation 3aChihuahuan Desert1 aPeters, Debra P.

These studies all suggest that a 300 to 600 ppm doubling of the atmosphere's CO2 concentration could raise the planet's mean surface air temperature by only about 0.4°C. Even this modicum of warming may never be realized, however, for it could be negated by a number of planetary cooling forces that are intensified by warmer temperatures and by the strengthening of biological processes that are enhanced by the same rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration that drives the warming. Several of these cooling forces have individually been estimated to be of equivalent magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the typically predicted greenhouse effect of a doubling of the air's CO2 content, which suggests to me that little net temperature change will ultimately result from the ongoing buildup of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere. Consequently, I am skeptical of the predictions of significant CO2-induced global warming that are being made by state-of-the-art climate models and believe that much more work on a wide variety of research fronts will be required to properly resolve the issue.  aPubAg article 3acarbon dioxide 3aair temperature 3agreenhouse effect 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aglobal warming 3aair 3asurface temperature 3aclimate models 3aprediction 0aatmosphere0 tClimate research.g1998, v. 10, no. 1 p.69-82x0936-577X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl4620463  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/547923Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr0100693Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4620463b0936-577Xc10d1e69  fClimate research  aissued  aIND446205009ExL  a2013-03-04  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/110339_IdsoPotential1996.pdf  aARS submission  aUSDA/ARS  aJournal title changed from 'Climate research'  aBatch:67 annotated on 2012-11-02T09:46:08Z  aBatch:67 reviewed on 2012-11-13T18:00:01Z  aagid:54792  a2011-10-18  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.77 2012/03/23)  a462050004962nab a2200649 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100018400171245014300355300001800498500002000516520207500536592002802611593001802639650001902657650002102676650002102697650002402718650001302742650001102755650002102766650002402787650001002811651001102821651001102832700010802843700014202951700010903093700014403202700014503346700008903491773013003580787003303710787001803743787002403761856007303785912001203858914004703870914003003917916001503947917001103962918004303973935002204016949001504038953005704053954006104110955003404171961001204205962004804217974001704265983001504282984001504297991610542720742620221120130953.0200814e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070716922DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.130782doi  aagid:7071692-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, AnanthaeauthoruNorthern Institute of Applied Climate Science and Northern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Delaware, OH, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4645-626010aCombining US and Canadian forest inventories to assess habitat suitability and migration potential of 25 tree species under climate change  ap. 1142-1159.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To evaluate current and future dynamics of 25 tree species spanning United States and Canada. LOCATION: United States and Canada. METHODS: We combine, for the first time, the species compositions from relative importance derived from the USA’s Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) with gridded estimates based on Canada's National Forest Inventory (NFI‐kNN))‐based photo plot data to evaluate future habitats and colonization potentials for 25 tree species. Using 21 climatic variables under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, we model climatic habitat suitability (HQ) within a consensus‐based multimodel ensemble regression approach. A migration model is used to assess colonization likelihoods (CL) for ~100 years and combined with HQ to evaluate the various combinations of HQ + CL outcomes for the 25 species. RESULTS: At a continental scale, many species in the conterminous United States lose suitable climatic habitat (especially under RCP 8.5) while Canada and USA’s Alaska gain climate habitat. For most species, even under optimistic migration rates, only a small portion of overall future suitable habitat is projected to be naturally colonized in ~100 years, although considerable variation exists among species. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: For the species examined here, habitat losses were primarily experienced along southern range limits, while habitat gains were associated with northern range limits (especially under RCP 8.5). However, for many species, southern range limits are projected to remain relatively intact, albeit with reduced habitat quality. Our models predict that only a small portion of the climatic habitat generated by climate change will be colonized naturally by the end of the current century—even with optimistic tree migration rates. However, considerable variation among species points to the need for significant management efforts, including assisted migration, for economic or ecological reasons. Our work highlights the need to employ range‐wide data, evaluate colonization potentials and enhance cross‐border collaborations.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aforest inventory 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3amodels 3anational forests 3aregression analysis 3atrees 3aAlaska 3aCanada1 aPedlar, JohneauthoruGreat Lakes Forestry Centre, Canadian Forest Service, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada1 aPeters, MatteauthoruNorthern Institute of Applied Climate Science and Northern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Delaware, OH, USA1 aMcKenney, DaneauthoruGreat Lakes Forestry Centre, Canadian Forest Service, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada1 aIverson, LouiseauthoruNorthern Institute of Applied Climate Science and Northern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Delaware, OH, USA1 aMatthews, SteveeauthoruNorthern Institute of Applied Climate Science and Northern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Delaware, OH, USA1 aAdams, BryceeauthoruSchool of Environment and Natural Resources, Columbus, OH, USA0 tDiversity & distributions.g2020 Sept., v. 26, no. 9 p.1142-1159dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl386707140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.130783Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3867071b1366-9516c26d9e1142  fDiversity & distributions  aBatch:2595  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6070716929ExL  a2020-10-30  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13669516_2020_26_9.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13669516_2020_26_9.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2595 reviewed on 2020-10-30T16:00:06Z  aagid:7071692  a2020-08-14  a2020-10-3003826nab a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100019000171245018600361520156000547592002802107593001802135650002402153650001902177650002002196650002102216650002202237650001502259650001302274650001502287650002102302650002202323650001002345651002602355700003202381700003202413700003402445773012102479787003302600787001802633787001802651856007302669912001202742914003602754914001202790916001502802917001102817918006702828935002202895949001502917953007002932954007403002955004103076961001203117962004803129974001703177983001503194984001503209991610622590742620221123041009.0191122e20191106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067702462DNAL7 a10.3390/f101109892doi  aagid:6770246-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIverson, Louis  R.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science, 359 Main Road, Delaware, OH 43015, USA. louis.iverson@usda.gov10aFacilitating Adaptive Forest Management under Climate Change: A Spatially Specific Synthesis of 125 Species for Habitat Changes and Assisted Migration over the Eastern United States  aWe modeled and combined outputs for 125 tree species for the eastern United States, using habitat suitability and colonization potential models along with an evaluation of adaptation traits. These outputs allowed, for the first time, the compilation of tree species&rsquo; current and future potential for each unit of 55 national forests and grasslands and 469 1 &times; 1 degree grids across the eastern United States. A habitat suitability model, a migration simulation model, and an assessment based on biological and disturbance factors were used with United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data to evaluate species potential to migrate or infill naturally into suitable habitats over the next 100 years. We describe a suite of variables, by species, for each unique geographic unit, packaged as summary tables describing current abundance, potential future change in suitable habitat, adaptability, and capability to cope with the changing climate, and colonization likelihood over 100 years. This resulting synthesis and summation effort, culminating over two decades of work, provides a detailed data set that incorporates habitat quality, land cover, and dispersal potential, spatially constrained, for nearly all the tree species of the eastern United States. These tables and maps provide an estimate of potential species trends out 100 years, intended to deliver managers and publics with practical tools to reduce the vast set of decisions before them as they proactively manage tree species in the face of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aUSDA Forest Service 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aforest inventory 3aforest management 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3anational forests 3asimulation models 3atrees 3aEastern United States1 aPrasad, Anantha  M.eauthor1 aPeters, Matthew  P.eauthor1 aMatthews, Stephen  N.eauthor0 tForests.g2019 Nov. 06, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)225740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f101109893Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:2257b1999-4907c10d11  fForests  aBatch:2595  aissued2 aMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing Instituteeprovider5DNAL  aIND6067702469ExL  a2020-10-30  a/data/metadata/incoming/mdpinstitute/forests-v10-i11-20191122.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/forests-v10-i11-20191122.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2595 reviewed on 2020-10-30T16:00:06Z  aagid:6770246  a2019-11-22  a2020-10-3005051nab a2200769 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003300098035002800131040001800159100009500177245008100272300001600353500002000369500000900389520238900398592002802787593001802815650001602833650001302849650001402862650001902876650002102895650000902916650001802925650001502943650001202958650001902970650001602989650002103005650001103026650001503037650000903052650001803061650001503079650002403094650001703118650001303135650001603148651002103164651001303185651002603198700009303224700009303317700009203410773021703502787003303719787001803752787002103770856008003791912001203871914004303883914003703926916001503963917001103978918004303989935002204032949001504054953005704069954006104126955003404187961001304221974001704234983001504251984001504266991610911880742620221121071554.0220811e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066639782DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2017.09.03792doi  aagid:6663978-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWienhold, Brian J.eauthoruUSDA‐ARS Agroecosystem Management Research Unit, Lincoln, NE10aSoil Carbon Response to Projected Climate Change in the US Western Corn Belt  ap. 704-709.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aThe western US Corn Belt is projected to experience major changes in growing conditions due to climate change over the next 50 to 100 yr. Projected changes include increases in growing season length, number of high temperature stress days and warm nights, and precipitation, with more heavy rainfall events. The impact these changes will have on soil organic carbon (SOC) needs to be estimated and adaptive changes in management developed to sustain soil health and system services. The process‐based model CQESTR was used to model changes in SOC stocks (0–30 cm) of continuous corn (Zea mays L.) and a corn–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation under disk, chisel, ridge, and no‐tillage using projected growing season conditions for the next 50 yr. Input for the model was based on management and harvest records from a long‐term tillage study (1986–2015) in eastern Nebraska, and model output was validated using measured changes in SOC from 1999 to 2011 in the study. The validated model was used to estimate changes in SOC over 17 yr under climatic conditions projected for 2065 under two scenarios: (i) crop yields increasing at the observed rate from 1971 to 2016 or (ii) crop yields reduced due to negative effects of increasing temperature. CQESTR estimates of SOC agreed well with measured SOC (R² = 0.70, P < 0.0001). Validated model simulated changes in SOC under projected climate change differed among the three soil depths (0–7.5, 7.5–15, and 15–30 cm). Summed over the 0‐ to 30‐cm depth, there were significant three‐way interactions of year × rotation × yield (p = 0.014) and year × tillage × yield (p < 0.001). As yield increased, SOC increased under no‐tillage continuous corn but was unchanged under no‐tillage corn–soybean and ridge tillage regardless of cropping system. Under chisel and disk tillage, SOC declined regardless of cropping system. With declining yields SOC decreased regardless of tillage or cropping system. These results highlight the interaction between genetics and management in maintaining yield trends and soil C. CORE IDEAS: Improvements in management and genetics will be needed to maintain or increase C sequestration. Conservation tillage practices that minimize soil disturbance sustain soil organic C. Decreasing crop yields will require additional input to sustain current soil organic C levels.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3achiseling 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3acrop yield 3adiscing 3agrowing season 3aheat stress 3amodel validation 3amodels 3ano-tillage 3arain 3aridge tillage 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3aCorn Belt region 3aNebraska 3aWestern United States1 aJin, Virginia L.eauthoruUSDA‐ARS Agroecosystem Management Research Unit, Lincoln, NE1 aSchmer, Marty R.eauthoruUSDA‐ARS Agroecosystem Management Research Unit, Lincoln, NE1 aVarvel, Gary E.eauthoruUSDA‐ARS Agroecosystem Management Research Unit, Lincoln, NE0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2018 July, v. 47, no. 4 p.704-709dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl164240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2017.09.03793Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl1642b0047-2425c47d4e704  fJournal of environmental quality  aBatch:2359  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6066639789ExL  a2020-01-22  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/00472425_2018_47_4.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/00472425_2018_47_4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6663978  a2022-08-11  a2022-08-1103987nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100012300182245015500305300001400460520137000474592002801844593001801872650002601890650001901916650001101935650001701946650001901963650002101982650002002003650002302023650002502046650002702071650002202098650002502120650001602145651002502161653002602186653003202212653004502244653002702289653002202316653001802338653000802356653000802364653000802372653000802380700019702388773011302585787003302698787001802731787001902749856008402768912001202852914003902864914005002903916001502953917001102968918004302979935002203022949001503044953005403059961000903113962004803122962004803170974001703218983001503235984001503250991610999770742620221121135129.0150325e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012264792DNAL7 a10.1080/21606544.2014.9631652doi  aagid:1226479-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalatnik, Ruslana RacheleauthoruDepartment of Economics and Management, The Max Stern Yezreel Valley College, Israel10aEconomic valuation of climate change-induced biodiversity impacts on agriculture: results from a macro-economic application to the Mediterranean basin  ap. 45-63.  aIt is clear that climate change involves changes in temperature and precipitation and, therefore, directly affects land productivity. However, this is not the only channel for climatic change to affect agro-systems. Biodiversity is also subject to climatic change. The present paper illustrates a unique attempt to economically assess the potential effects of climate change induced impacts of biodiversity on the agricultural sector in terms of changes in land productivity, changes in agricultural output and, ultimately, changes in national GDPs. Economic valuation shows that climate change induced impacts on biodiversity cause significant changes in GDP. However, the intensity of these changes varies across the economies under consideration. Some countries, and respective economies, show to be less resilient than others and, most of the time, the welfare changes involved clearly signal the presence of winners and losers. For example, the majority of non-EU Mediterranean economies are subject to a negative impact in their national GDP due to climate change-induced impacts on biodiversity that will be hampering the negative effect of climatic conditions on agro-ecosystems. These results reiterate the importance of welfare analyses of climate change-caused impacts on biodiversity that focus on the redistributive aspects involved with these impacts.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aagricultural industry 3aagroecosystems 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acrop production 3aeconomic valuation 3aenvironmental impact 3agross domestic product 3aland productivity 3alivestock production 3atemperature 3aMediterranean region 0aautonomous adaptation 0amicro-econometric modelling 0acomputable general equilibrium modelling 0abiodiversity indicator 0aland productivity 0ahuman welfare 0aC68 0aQ15 0aQ54 0aQ571 aLourenço Dias Nunes, Paulo AugustoeauthoruAgriculture and Environmental Services Department, Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES), The World Bank, WashingtonDC, USA0 tJournal of environmental economics and policy.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 4, no. 1 p.45-63dRoutledgex2160-65527nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1968540uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21606544.2014.9631653Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:19685b2160-6552c4d1e45  fJournal of environmental economics and policy  aBatch:1036  aissued2 aTaylor & Francis Groupeprovider5DNAL  aIND6012264799ExL  a2015-09-17  ateep20_teep20.v004.i01_20150323192053#5813433.zip  aUSDA  aBatch:1036 reviewed on 2015-09-11T16:00:03Z  aBatch:1036 reviewed on 2015-09-17T16:00:02Z  aagid:1226479  a2015-03-25  a2015-09-1701695nab a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075035002800097040001800125072001700143072001700160072001700177100002000194245005000214500001500264650002200279650001600301650002200317650001900339650002200358650002200380650002000402650002000422650001200442653001900454653001000473773018000483787003300663852000900696912001200705914013500717917001100852930003300863935002100896945002500917946001100942952005100953961001201004974001701016979002601033984001501059985010301074986001201177991611237440742620221120055133.0090123s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441526062DNAL  aagid:4870179-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The purpose of this simulation based study was to 1) assess the impact of future climate change on maize (Zea mays L.) yield in western Kansas; and 2) evaluate and understand the possible impacts of climate change on maize irrigation water productivity, transpiration, evapotranspiration and days to maturity. The Crop Estimation through Resource and Environment Synthesis (CERES-Maize) crop model within the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer Cropping Systems Model (DSSAT-CSM) was used in combination with multiple Global Climate Models under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and two irrigation scenarios [full (450mm) and deficit (300)] under three planting dates [early (20th April), normal (5th May) and late (15th May)]. Results showed that maize yield during the mid-21st century will decline relative to the present on average by 18–33% under RCP4.5 and 37–46% under RCP8.5. The yield decline might be caused mainly by shortening of the growing period (9–18% decline in days to maturity), attributed to elevated temperatures. The reduction in transpiration relative to the baseline reached 15% for RCP8.5 under deficit irrigation whereas the reduction was minimal (1–7%) under full irrigation. Indicating that significant yield reductions might occur due to combined effects of deficit irrigation and shortening of the maturity period. Yield increase due to elevated CO2 concentration [CO2] might be masked by the increased temperatures. The current study showed large disparity in simulated yield among the various GCMs. Planting date did not substantially improve yield but there was less simulation variability among GCMs with early planting compared to normal and late planting. There was no substantial difference among the planting dates for water productivity, however, there was a slight tendency of improvement in irrigation water productivity for deficit irrigation under early planting compared to normal and late planting. Under all planting dates and RCPs, the irrigation water productivity of maize under deficit irrigation was slightly higher than that under full irrigation. The difference in irrigation water productivity of maize between the deficit and full irrigation was larger for early compared to normal and late planting. These differences justify that early planting may be suitable under future climate compared to late planting even though the simulated yield with early planting under similar RCPs and irrigation levels are not significantly different from late planting.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acorn 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3adecision support systems 3adeficit irrigation 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3aplanting date 3arisk management 3atemperature 3atranspiration 3awater supply 3aKansas 0aMaize 0aIrrigation 0aRCP 0aGCM 0aDSSAT-CSM 0aClimate change1 aKisekka, I.eauthoruKansas State University, Southwest Research and Extension Center, Garden City, KS, United States1 aLin, X.eauthoruKansas State University, Department of Agronomy, Manhattan, KS, United States1 aVara Prasad, P.V.eauthoruKansas State University, Sustainable Intensification Innovation Lab, United States1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6632-33611 aGowda, P.H.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Grazinglands Research Laboratory, United States1 aRice, C.eauthoruKansas State University, Department of Agronomy, Manhattan, KS, United States1 aAndales, A.eauthoruColorado State University, Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, Fort Collins, CO, United States0 tClimate risk management.g2017, v. 17 p.139-154dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23250x2212-09637nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2325040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2017.08.0013Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5813490  aArticle  aJournal:23250b2212-0963c17e139  fClimate risk management  aBatch:1853  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6058134909ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/22-2-00082-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S2212096317300220.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 2212-0963  aMissing ISSN  aagid:5813490  a2018-09-05  a2022-09-0606196nab a2200841 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098035002800137040001800165100010400183245009200287300001600379520155900395536073701954592002802691593001802719596005102737596003902788596006202827650001202889650001902901650002302920650001602943650002402959650001402983650002102997650002203018650001003040650001303050650001003063650001703073650001803090651001403108653000803122653002303130653001703153653001603170700009203186700010003278700013403378700010803512700009603620700014003716700009403856700009203950700009004042700015504132700013804287700013204425773012504557787003304682787001804715787002204733856008504755912001204840914004404852914003404896916001504930917001104945918004304956935002204999949001505021953009305036954007205129955004205201961001605243962004805259974001705307983001505324984001505339991611562610742620221120175533.0191113e20191002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067600152DNAL7 a10.1080/10402381.2019.16226122doi  aagid:6760015-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagee, Madeline R.eauthoruCenter for Limnology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA10aScientific advances and adaptation strategies for Wisconsin lakes facing climate change  ap. 364-381.  aMagee, MR, Hein CL, Walsh JR, Shannon PD, Vander Zanden MJ, Campbell TB, Hansen GJA, Hauxwell J, LaLiberte, GD, Parks TP, Sass GG, Swanston CW, Janowiak MK. 2019. Scientific advances and adaptation strategies for Wisconsin lakes facing climate change. Lake Reserv Manage. 35:364–381. Climate change threatens inland lakes, which are highly valued for their ecological and economic benefits. Here, we synthesize adaptation strategies that could offset climate impacts on Midwestern lakes. Our synthesis is based on results from the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts lake adaptation workshop, in which 48 researchers and managers with expertise on Wisconsin’s inland lakes gathered to provide input on climate adaptation strategies. We identified recent scientific advances, knowledge gaps, and examples of successful climate adaptation strategies with respect to four key themes: lake levels, water quality, aquatic invasive species, and fisheries. While adaptation strategies for each theme differed, there was consensus around the need for a multifaceted approach that incorporates communication and outreach, policy and regulation changes, traditional resource conservation approaches, and novel engineering designs. Managers should focus on protecting high-quality lakes, building lake resilience, and retaining beneficial ecosystem services. Most importantly, thoughtful and strategic interactions with stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers across multiple disciplines will be key to implementing climate adaptation strategies.  aFunding for the workshop was provided to the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts through a grant from the U.S. Geological Survey (grant/cooperative agreement no.

Adapting to climate change: Guidance for the management of inland glacial lake fisheries. Lake Reserv Manage. 35:435–452. Climate change is altering glacial lake fisheries in the United States, presenting a complex challenge for fisheries managers. Here we provide a regional perspective to guide management of heterogeneous and yet interdependent fishery resources in glacial lakes of the upper Midwest. Our main objective was to promote the adaptation of inland glacial lakes fisheries management to climate change by outlining processes that support regional plans. Using examples from the glacial lakes region, we outline an approach for regional prioritization, specify strategies for moving from regional prioritization to on-the-ground action, and provide guidance on the implementation of management plans given resource limitations and potential stakeholder conflict. We find that integrating ecological, social, and economic data with climate change vulnerability assessments can be useful in generating “lake-priority levels” to help identify where to focus actions to support system resilience. Managers can use lake-priority levels and ecosystem-specific strategies to make decisions about where and when to apply fisheries management action ranging from traditional (i.e., stocking, harvest regulations) to nontraditional approaches (i.e., catchment land management). Although the implementation of several approaches may be beyond an agency’s financial and logistical capacity, funds can be secured through other sources ranging from grant programs to nontraditional partnerships identified by “thinking outside the lake.” Regional plans may be an important step toward successful climate adaptation for inland glacial lakes fisheries management, and the proactive efforts of managers may help facilitate their development and implementation.  aFinancial support for this research was provided by the US Geological Survey (USGS)–Missouri Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit through research grant G18AC00357 from the USGS National Climate Adaptation Science Center.

However, few studies have investigated the interactive effects of tree harvest and climate change on tree species distributions. We assessed the interactive effects of tree harvest and climate change on the distribution of 29 dominant tree species at 270 m resolution in the southern United States, while accounting for species demography, competition, urban growth and natural fire. We simulated tree species distribution changes to year 2100 using a coupled forest dynamic model (LANDIS PRO), ecosystem process model (LINKAGES) and urban growth model (SLEUTH). The distributions of 20 tree species contracted and nine species expanded within the region under climate change by end of 21st century. Distribution changes for all tree species were very slow and lagged behind the changes in potential distributions that were in equilibrium with new climatic conditions. Tree harvest and climate change interacted to affect species occurrences and colonization but not extinction. Occurrence and colonization were mainly affected by tree harvest and its interaction with climate change while extinctions were mainly affected by tree harvest and climate change. Synthesis and applications. Interactive effects of climate and tree harvest acted in the same direction as climate change effects on species occurrences, thereby accelerating climate change induced contraction or expansion of distributions. The overall interactive effects on species colonization were negative, specifically with positive interactive effects at leading edges of species ranges and negative interactive effects at trailing edges. Tree harvest generally did not interact with climate change to greatly facilitate or ameliorate species extinction. Our modelling results highlight the importance of considering disturbances and species demography (e.g. post‐harvest regeneration dynamics) when predicting changes in tree distributions.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSGSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000203  cUniversity of Missouridhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007165  aY7H7031001cChinese Academy of Sciences  aY8B7051001cChinese Academy of Sciences  a41871045cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cUSGS Northeast Climate Science Center  cUniversity of Missouri‐Columbia  cUSDA Forest Service Northern Research Station0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3ademography 3adynamic models 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3agrowth models 3aprediction 3asynergism 3atrees 3aurbanization 3aSoutheastern United States1 aThompson, Frank R., IIIcIIIeauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Columbia, Missouri1 aHe, Hong S.eauthoruSchool of Natural Resources, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri1 aFraser, Jacob S.eauthoruSchool of Natural Resources, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri1 aDijak, William D.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Columbia, Missouri1 aJones‐Farrand, ToddeauthoruGulf Coastal Plains & Ozarks Landscape Conservation Cooperative, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri0 tjournal of ecology.g2019 July, v. 107, no. 4 p.1901-1917dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4466040uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.131443Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44660b0022-0477c107d4e1901  fjournal of ecology  aBatch:2293  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6064873609ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/00220477_2019_107_4.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/00220477_2019_107_4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2293 reviewed on 2019-09-04T14:00:03Z  aagid:6487360  a2019-07-01  a2020-03-0605299nab a2200841 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004000098024003700138035002800175040001800203100011800221245010000339506007600439506003100515520205600546592002802602593001802630596003002648596004702678506003702725650003102762650003402793650001202827650001902839650000902858650001602867650001302883650002602896650001602922650002302938650002402961650000902985650001102994650002203005650000903027650001303036650001603049650002103065650002503086650001003111653001503121653003203136653002103168653002603189700011603215700011003331700012503441700012803566773013203694787003303826787001803859787002103877856008403898912001203982914004403994914003404038916001604072917001104088918003604099935002204135949001504157952001904172953009304191954006104284955003504345961001304380962001704393974001704410983001504427984001504442991611788820742620221207123335.0210812e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074228042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1070422chorus7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1070422doi  aagid:7422804-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, YizhuoeauthoruDepartment of Crop, Soil and Environment Sciences, Auburn University, AL 36849, United States10aClimate change and cover crop effects on water use efficiency of a corn-soybean rotation system  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aClimate change led to increased temperature and variable rainfall, which may pose great threats to both agricultural productions and environmental impacts. In this study, we aim to explore how changing climate and its extremes in the 20th and 21st-century influence system water use efficiency (sWUE) of a corn-soybean cropping rotation in a humid sub-tropic environment, and how much can cover crops mitigate these impacts. Different from the traditional yield-focused water use efficiency (WUE), sWUE addresses both production and environmental quality goals by considering grain yields and all major system water losses (evapotranspiration, runoff, and drainage). A calibrated crop simulation model, Root Zone Water Quality Model version 2 (RZWQM2), was applied to simulate grain yields and all major system water losses. The model was forced by daily climate data from in situ observations during 1956–2015 and 10 downscaled and bias corrected General Circulation Model (GCMs) projections under the representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios during 2020–2079. The results showed that, under the historical baseline and the future RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, due to the growth of cover crops, the sWUE for corn were improved by 1.7%, 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively (p-value < 0.001), and for soybean by 0.7% (p = 0.06), 1.0% (p-value < 0.001) and 0.9% (p-value < 0.001). Soil evaporation, as the largest source of water loss from the cropping system, was significantly decreased by 1.7%, 2.6% and 2.3% during the corn growing season, and by 0.7%, 1.0% and 0.9% during the soybean growing season. The annual drainage was decreased by 38 mm, 53 mm and 67 mm, under the baseline, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. With the incorporation of wheat cover crops, the correlations of temperature or precipitation extremes with grain yields and major water losses were mostly decreased, suggesting that growing cover crop is an effective means to mitigate the impact of climate extremes on sWUE of a corn-soybean cropping.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cChina Scholarship Council  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aRoot Zone Water Quality Model 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acover crops 3adrainage 3aenvironmental quality 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3ameteorological data 3arain 3arunoff 3asimulation models 3asoil 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3awater management 3awater use efficiency 3awheat 0aCover crop 0aSystem water use efficiency 0aClimate extremes 0aCrop simulation model1 aTian, DieauthoruDepartment of Crop, Soil and Environment Sciences, Auburn University, AL 36849, United States1 aFeng, GaryeauthoruUSDA-ARS, Genetics and Sustainable Agriculture Research Unit, MS 39762, United States1 aYang, WeieauthoruCollege of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China1 aFeng, LipingeauthoruCollege of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 255 p.107042-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1070423Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774c255e107042  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:10192  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6074228049ExL  a2022-02-22  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/997739115798906666-00002-HEAD-ONLY-REVISEDSUBJECTLIST.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0378377421003073.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aMissing ISSN  aagid:7422804  a2021-08-12  a2022-09-0203516nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097024002100132035002600153040001800179072000900197072000900206100002100215245009200236300001600328500002400344520141300368593001801781593002001799650001901819650001601838650001601854650001601870650001501886650001301901650002201914650002301936651001101959700001801970700001801988700001802006700002002024773009902044787001802143787003302161787003002194787002102224852000902245856011202254856008502366912001202451914004502463914002002508917001102528930003302539935002102572945002502593946001302618949001502631952005102646961001202697974001502709984001502724985010302739986001202842991611854300742620221120031818.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439922132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-007-9294-82doi7 a10113/320012hdl  aagid:32001-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aP2001 aTague, Christina10aDeep groundwater mediates streamflow response to climate warming in the Oregon Cascades  ap. 189-210.  aIncludes references  aRecent studies predict that projected climate change will lead to significant reductions in summer streamflow in the mountainous regions of the Western US. Hydrologic modeling directed at quantifying these potential changes has focused on the magnitude and timing of spring snowmelt as the key control on the spatial-temporal pattern of summer streamflow. We illustrate how spatial differences in groundwater dynamics can also play a significant role in determining streamflow responses to warming. We examine two contrasting watersheds, one located in the Western Cascades and the other in the High Cascades mountains of Oregon. We use both empirical analysis of streamflow data and physically based, spatially distributed modeling to disentangle the relative importance of multiple and interacting controls. In particular, we explore the extent to which differences in snow accumulation and melt and drainage characteristics (deep ground water vs. shallow subsurface) mediate the effect of climate change. Results show that within the Cascade Range, local variations in bedrock geology and concomitant differences in volume and seasonal fluxes of subsurface water will likely result in significant spatial variability in responses to climate forcing. Specifically, watersheds dominated by High Cascade geology will show greater absolute reductions in summer streamflow with predicted temperature increases.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aglobal warming 3agroundwater 3awater table 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3asnowmelt 3ahydrologic models 3atemporal variation 3aOregon1 aGrant, Gordon1 aFarrell, Mike1 aChoate, Janet1 aJefferson, Anne0 tClimatic change.g2008 Jan., v.  86, no.  1-2 p.189-210dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl8952  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/320013Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-007-9294-83Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c86d1-2e189  fClimatic change  aissued  a20090804b20091002c00000000  aIND439922139ExL  aINDdGAYe2009/08/04  aOther US  a2016-09-13  a20090804 20091002 00000000bIND GAY 2009/08/04  aUSDA/FS  aagid:32001  a2009-10-03  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a399221303061nab a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098024003900134035002800173040001800201100014800219245007200367506007600439506003100515520087000546592002801416593001801444596000801462596000901470506003701479650001401516650001901530650001301549650001101562650001601573650001601589650001201605700014501617773011001762787003301872787001801905787001901923856008201942856004502024912001202069914002302081914004502104917001102149918002702160935002202187949001502209955003402224961000902258962004802267974001702315983003002332984001502362985010602377991612295840742620221215143318.0220901e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075752812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jedc.2021.1042622doi7 a10.1016/j.jedc.2021.1042622chorus  aagid:7575281-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, SangjuneauthoruClimate Change Research Team, Korea Energy Economics Institute, 405-11 Jongga-ro, Jung-gu, Ulsan 44543, Republic of Korea10aAdaptation to climate change: Extreme events versus gradual changes  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aGlobal climate change will lead to increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, on top of the gradual changes in temperature and precipitation. We develop a real options model of adaptation to climate change, capturing the different effects of gradual changes, represented by a Brownian motion process, and extreme events, represented by Poisson jumps with a hyper-exponential jump size distribution. We compare adaptation decisions under the increased frequency, severity, and tail thickness of extreme events as well as gradual changes. We find that while the adaptation incentives are higher in response to gradual changes, the probability of carrying out adaptation activities is higher in response to extreme events. The catalyst effects of extreme events become more significant when the tail distribution of the extreme events becomes heavier.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNSF  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalysts 3aclimate change 3adynamics 3amodels 3aprobability 3atemperature 3aweather1 aZhao, JinhuaeauthoruDyson School of Applied Economics and Management, Cornell University, 114 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853, United States0 tJournal of Economic Dynamics and Control.g2021 Dec., v. 133dElsevier BVwJournal:12463x0165-18897nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1246340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2021.1042623Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7575281  aArticle  aJournal:12463c133  fJournal of Economic Dynamics and Control  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6075752819ExL  a2022-05-05  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN  1873-1743  aagid:7575281  a2022-09-01T12:44:22-04:00  a2022-09-28  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl05385nab a2200769 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100012400171245007900295300001600374500002000390520224300410592002802653593001802681650001702699650001202716650002302728650002002751650001002771650002402781650001502805650001902820650001102839650002102850650002202871650002002893650001102913650001902924650002202943650000902965650001402974650001602988650002003004651003203024651001803056700010403074700011403178700010903292700012303401700011903524700012403643700012703767700012103894773013004015787003304145787001804178787002204196856007304218912001204291914004404303914002804347916001504375917001104390918004304401935002204444949001504466953002704481961001204508962004804520974001704568983001504585984001504600991612299030742620221120034502.0180102e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058763952DNAL7 a10.1890/13-0905.12doi  aagid:5876395-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Andrew J.eauthoruEcology Department, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana 59717 USA. hansen@montana.edu10aExposure of U.S. National Parks to land use and climate change 1900–2100  ap. 484-502.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany protected areas may not be adequately safeguarding biodiversity from human activities on surrounding lands and global change. The magnitude of such change agents and the sensitivity of ecosystems to these agents vary among protected areas. Thus, there is a need to assess vulnerability across networks of protected areas to determine those most at risk and to lay the basis for developing effective adaptation strategies. We conducted an assessment of exposure of U.S. National Parks to climate and land use change and consequences for vegetation communities. We first defined park protected‐area centered ecosystems (PACEs) based on ecological principles. We then drew on existing land use, invasive species, climate, and biome data sets and models to quantify exposure of PACEs from 1900 through 2100. Most PACEs experienced substantial change over the 20th century (>740% average increase in housing density since 1940, 13% of vascular plants are presently nonnative, temperature increase of 1°C/100 yr since 1895 in 80% of PACEs), and projections suggest that many of these trends will continue at similar or increasingly greater rates (255% increase in housing density by 2100, temperature increase of 2.5°–4.5°C/100 yr, 30% of PACE areas may lose their current biomes by 2030). In the coming century, housing densities are projected to increase in PACEs at about 82% of the rate of since 1940. The rate of climate warming in the coming century is projected to be 2.5–5.8 times higher than that measured in the past century. Underlying these averages, exposure of individual park PACEs to change agents differ in important ways. For example, parks such as Great Smoky Mountains exhibit high land use and low climate exposure, others such as Great Sand Dunes exhibit low land use and high climate exposure, and a few such as Point Reyes exhibit high exposure on both axes. The cumulative and synergistic effects of such changes in land use, invasives, and climate are expected to dramatically impact ecosystem function and biodiversity in national parks. These results are foundational to developing effective adaptation strategies and suggest policies to better safeguard parks under broad‐scale environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aconservation areas 3adata collection 3adunes 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aglobal warming 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3amodels 3anational parks 3aplant communities 3arisk 3asynergism 3atemperature 3avascular plants 3aGreat Smoky Mountain region 3aUnited States1 aPiekielek, NathaneauthoruEcology Department, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana 59717 USA1 aDavis, CoryeauthoruCollege of Forestry and Conservation, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana 59812 USA1 aHaas, JessicaeauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Missoula, Montana 59807 USA1 aTheobald, David M.eauthoruNational Park Service, Inventory and Monitoring Division, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525 USA1 aGross, John E.eauthoruNational Park Service, Inventory and Monitoring Division, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525 USA1 aMonahan, William B.eauthoruNational Park Service, Inventory and Monitoring Division, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525 USA1 aOlliff, TomeauthoruUSGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, 2327 University Way, Suite 2, Bozeman, Montana 59715 USA1 aRunning, Steven W.eauthoruCollege of Forestry and Conservation, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana 59812 USA0 tEcological applications.g2014 Apr., v. 24, no. 3 p.484-502dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4719340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0905.13Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl47193b1051-0761c24d3e484  fEcological applications  aBatch:1910  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058763959ExL  a2018-02-28  a10510761_2014_24_3.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1910 reviewed on 2018-02-28T15:00:02Z  aagid:5876395  a2018-01-02  a2018-02-2804213nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100016200182245010500344300001400449520090000463592002801363593001801391650001701409650001201426650001901438650001501457650002801472650001501500651001101515700015001526700014101676700017401817700013501991700013402126700013502260700017502395700013302570700012202703773012502825787003302950787001802983787001803001856008503019912001203104914002803116914005203144916001503196917001103211918003603222935002203258949001503280953008903295954006103384955003503445961001203480962004803492974001703540983001503557984001503572991612846580742620221121012410.0191231e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066297682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2019.08.0052doi  aagid:6629768-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraujo, MoacyreauthoruUFPE - Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Av.

This work aims at building climate change cause–effect research from a ‘Nexus+’ perspective, considering the added value of flexibility and adaptability of the concept. The article draws on the Nexus literature alongside a case study in São Francisco River Basin, Northeast Brazil. An additional pillar to the Nexus approach is proposed here, the socio-ecological security, which can be defined as a political-territorial dimension of coupled social and ecological systems. A collaborative research-practice frame was applied to the study region, a hotspot of climate vulnerability in Brazil. Our results highlight the need for this fourth component to address socio-ecological sustainability into context.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3asustainable development 3awatersheds 3aBrazil1 aOmetto, JeaneauthoruINPE – Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, Av. dos Astronautas, 1758, São José dos Campos, 12227-010, SP, Brazil1 aRodrigues-Filho, SauloeauthoruUnB – Universidade de Brasília, Campus Universitário Darcy Ribeiro, Brasília, 70910-900, DF, Brazil1 aBursztyn, MarceleauthoruUnB – Universidade de Brasília, Campus Universitário Darcy Ribeiro, Brasília, 70910-900, DF, Brazil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2680-91451 aLindoso, Diego PeauthoruUnB – Universidade de Brasília, Campus Universitário Darcy Ribeiro, Brasília, 70910-900, DF, Brazil1 aLitre, GabrielaeauthoruUnB – Universidade de Brasília, Campus Universitário Darcy Ribeiro, Brasília, 70910-900, DF, Brazil1 aGaivizzo, LarisaeauthoruUnB – Universidade de Brasília, Campus Universitário Darcy Ribeiro, Brasília, 70910-900, DF, Brazil1 aFerreira, Julia LeauthoruUnB – Universidade de Brasília, Campus Universitário Darcy Ribeiro, Brasília, 70910-900, DF, Brazil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3891-61481 aReis, Rafael MeauthoruUnB – Universidade de Brasília, Campus Universitário Darcy Ribeiro, Brasília, 70910-900, DF, Brazil1 aAssad, EduardoeauthoruEMBRAPA Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária, Campus da Unicamp, Campinas, SP, Brazil0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2019 Aug., v. 39 p.62-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)223740uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2019.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:2237b1877-3435  fCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability  aBatch:2411  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6066297689ExL  a2020-03-02  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/561633683058420811-00003-HEAD-ONLY-NEWCONSYNISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S1877343518301337.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/DA  aBatch:2411 reviewed on 2020-03-02T04:00:04Z  aagid:6629768  a2019-12-31  a2020-03-0203823nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002000097035002500117040001800142072000900160072000900169072000900178100001800187245006800205300001400273500002400287500001500311520167100326593001801997593002002015650001402035650002202049650001102071650001402082650003702096650002102133650001902154650001902173650001702192650001602209650001102225650001302236651001802249653001802267653001502285653002202300700001702322700001702339773010602356787001802462787003302480787003002513787001802543852000902561856011102570912001202681914003902693914004302732917001102775930003302786935002102819945002502840946001302865949001502878952005102893961001302944974001402957984001502971985010302986986001203089991613091310742620221120034748.0050628e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437183912DNAL7 a10113/68192hdl  aagid:6819-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aB200 0aX1001 aNearing, M.A.10aExpected climate change impacts on soil erosion rates: a review  ap. 43-50.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGlobal warming is expected to lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle, including more total rainfall and more frequent high intensity rainfall events. Rainfall amounts and intensities increased on average in the United States during the 20th century, and according to climate change models they are expected to continue to increase during the 21st century. These rainfall changes, along with expected changes in temperature, solar radiation, and atmospheric CO (sub 2) concentrations, will have significant impacts on soil erosion rates. The processes involved in the impact of climate change on soil erosion by water are complex, involving changes in rainfall amounts and intensities, number of days of precipitation, ratio of rain to snow, plant biomass production, plant residue decomposition rates, soil microbial activity, evapotranspiration rates, and shifts in land use necessary to accommodate a new climatic regime. This paper reviews several recent studies conducted by the authors that address the potential effects of climate change on soil erosion rates. The results show cause for concern. Rainfall erosivity levels may be on the rise across much of the United States. Where rainfall amounts increase, erosion and runoff will increase at an even greater rate: the ratio of erosion increase to annual rainfall increase is on the order of 1.7. Even in cases where annual rainfall would decrease, system feedbacks related to decreased biomass production could lead to greater susceptibility of the soil to erode. Results also show how farmers' response to climate change can potentially exacerbate, or ameliorate, the changes in erosion rates expected.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3asediments 3asoil conservation 3acanopy 3aequations 3aWater Erosion Prediction Project 3avegetation cover 3aclimate change 3arain intensity 3asoil erosion 3atemperature 3arunoff 3aland use 3aUnited States 0aprecipitation 0avegetation 0ahydrologic models1 aPruski, F.F.1 aO'Neal, M.R.0 tJournal of soil and water conservation.g2004 , v.  59, no.  1 p.43-50wJournal:1947x0022-45617nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)1947  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/68193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:1947b0022-4561c59d1e43  fJournal of soil and water conservation  aissued  a20071121b20071210c00000000  aIND437183919ExL  aINDdLYNe2007/11/19  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20071121 20071210 00000000bIND LYN 2007/11/19  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6819  a2007-12-10  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a371839104201nab a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100018000179245012800359300001200487520160900499592002802108593001802136650001502154650001202169650001902181650003302200650001502233650002102248650002002269650001502289650001502304650000902319650001602328650001702344651001102361700026302372700026702635773013502902787003303037787001803070787002403088856008203112912001203194914004703206914003303253916001503286917001103301918002903312935002203341949001503363953006703378954005703445955003703502961001303539974001703552983001503569984001503584991613163830742620221122151102.0180619e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057942132DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-017-6751-12doi  aagid:5794213-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalloza, MagdaS.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, MSC 3 JER, NMSU, Box 30003, Las Cruces, NM, 88003, USA. mgalloza@gmail.com1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4713-195110aPredicting land at risk from wind erosion using an index-based framework under a climate change scenario in Durango, Mexico  ap. 560.  aLand degradation takes place primarily in drylands which make up for almost 50% of the cultivated lands, globally. The 90% of Mexican territory is currently experiencing land deterioration mainly due to anthropogenic land use changes and still expecting further deterioration. While efforts have been directed toward the impact of land use changes on wind erosion in dryland ecosystems, there is still high uncertainty on the nature of wind erosion sources. This challenge was addressed by developing and evaluating a method for completing spatial assessments of vulnerable zones currently experiencing accelerated soil erosion and to predict those areas where soil erosion is likely to occur in the near future. This approach is tested over a study area in the Comarca Lagunera, Durango, Mexico. Spatiotemporal patterns and variability in soil erosion and aridity were evaluated, as well as the identification of key characteristics driving soil degradation in the area. Results demonstrate that the suggested methodology can be effectively used to spatially delineate potential locations susceptible to soil degradation (e.g., moderate-risk zones and/or high-risk zones), not only in the present time but also to predict those locations in the near future. This provides the opportunity of spatially defined areas of interest based on specific relationships between edaphological properties and its vulnerability to climate variability. This type of approach could be valuable to identify critical locations that should be treated as a priority for monitoring and managing accelerated soil degradation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aarid lands 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3aland degradation 3aland use change 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3arisk 3auncertainty 3awind erosion 3aMexico1 aLópez-Santos, ArmandoeauthoruGraduate Programa in Recursos Bióticos y Medio Ambiente de Zonas Áridas, Unidad Regional Universitaria de Zonas Áridas, Universidad Autónoma Chapingo, Km. 40 Rd.

Assessing the vulnerability of regional crop production systems to such an altered climate in the future is essential for implementing appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies for sustainable agriculture. We investigated the possible impacts of climate change (CC) projected by multiple global climate models (GCMs) on rainfed and irrigated corn (Zea mays L., a C4 plant) in the Lower Mississippi Delta region (LMD), USA. The CSM-CROPGRO-Maize v4.6 module in the RZWQM2 model (hereafter referred to as the “corn model”) was previously calibrated and validated for modeling corn at Stoneville, Mississippi, a representative location in the LMD was used. The CC scenarios considered in this study were ensembles of climate projections of multiple GCMs (97 ensemble members) that participated in the Climate Model Inter-comparison and Improvement Program 5. These CC scenarios were bias-corrected and spatially downscaled (BCSD) at the location for the years 2050 and 2080. Four representative GHG concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 drove these CC scenarios. Under both irrigated and rainfed conditions, corn yield responses to enhanced CO₂ were weak; thus, yield declined significantly in response to the enhanced air temperatures under all the RCP scenarios in both 2050 and 2080. The yield declines across RCPs ranged between 10 and 62% under irrigated conditions, and between 9 and 60% under rainfed conditions, mainly due to increased frequency of extreme temperatures and reduced crop durations. Water use efficiency declined between 22 and 150% under irrigated, and 8 and 54% under rainfed management. As an adaptation measure, planting corn up to 9 weeks earlier in the season, in general, failed to boost yields from increased crop duration and reduction in upper extreme air temperatures, as incidences of lower extreme temperatures also increased alarmingly. Development of cultivars that are more heat tolerant and produce higher yields under extreme temperatures would be required to combat corn yield decline in the region from climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aC4 plants 3aZea mays 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acorn 3acultivars 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat tolerance 3ahumid zones 3airrigation 3ariver deltas 3asustainable agriculture 3awater use efficiency 3aMississippi 3aMississippi Delta region1 aPinnamaneni, Srinivasa R.eauthoruSustainable Water Management Research Unit, USDA-ARS, P.O.

These changes will affect trees directly and also indirectly through effects on "nuisance" species, such as insect pests, pathogens, and invasive plants. We review how basic ecological principles can be used to predict nuisance species' responses to climate change and how this is likely to impact northeastern forests. We then examine in detail the potential responses of two pest species (hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) and forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hubner)), two pathogens (armillaria root rot (Armillaria spp.) and beech bark disease (Cryptococcus fagisuga Lind. + Neonectria spp.)), and two invasive plant species (glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus Mill.) and oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb.)). Several of these species are likely to have stronger or more widespread effects on forest composition and structure under the projected climate. However, uncertainty pervades our predictions because we lack adequate data on the species and because some species depend on complex, incompletely understood, unstable relationships. While targeted research will increase our confidence in making predictions, some uncertainty will always persist. Therefore, we encourage policies that allow for this uncertainty by considering a wide range of possible scenarios.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aclimate change 3aforest ecosystems 3ainvasive species 3ainsect pests 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3anoxious weeds 3aAdelges tsugae 3aMalacosoma disstria 3aArmillaria 3aCryptococcus fagisuga 3aFrangula alnus 3aCelastrus 3aforest pests 3aclimatic factors 3aprediction 3aNortheastern United States 3aCanada 0aCelastrus orbiculatus1 aPontius, Jennifer1 aOrwig, David1 aGarnas, Jeffrey R.1 aRodgers, Vikki L.1 aBrazee, Nicholas1 aCooke, Barry1 aTheoharides, Kathleen A.1 aStange, Erik E.1 aHarrington, Robin0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2009 Feb., v.  39, no.  2 p.231-248x0045-50677nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl2003  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X08-1713Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/267233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl2003b0045-5067c39d2e231  fCanadian journal of forest research =  aissued  a20090316b20090508c00000000  aIND441719529ExL  aINDdLYNe2009/03/12  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20090316 20090508 00000000bIND LYN 2009/03/12  aUSDA/FS  aagid:26723  a2009-05-22  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a417195204264nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002300115024002600138024001200164035002800176040001800204100008400222245008400306300001600390500002000406506017300426520121700599592002801816593001801844594002201862593002001884650001601904650001701920650001201937650001901949650001801968650002501986650002202011650002102033650001402054650001302068650000902081700007602090700013202166700020302298700009802501700008602599773012202685787003302807787001802840787001902858856011402877856007302991912001203064914004103076914004503117916001503162917001103177918004303188935002203231949001503253953002703268956008503295961001303380962004803393962003003441974001703471983001503488984001503503986001203518991613909270742620221214224429.0171003e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058085232DNAL7 a3366362aris7 a10113/58085232hdl7 a10.1002/fee.15302doi8 ans13546  aagid:5808523-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebb, Nicholas PeauthoruUSDA‐ARS Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM10aLand degradation and climate change: building climate resilience in agriculture  ap. 450-459.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aLand degradation and climate change pose enormous risks to global food security. Land degradation increases the vulnerability of agroecological systems to climate change and reduces the effectiveness of adaptation options. Yet these interactions have largely been omitted from climate impact assessments and adaptation planning. We examine how land degradation can influence climate‐change impacts and the adaptive capacity of crop and livestock producers across agroecological systems. We then present novel strategies for climate‐resilient agriculture that support opportunities to integrate responses to these challenges. Forward‐looking, climate‐resilient agriculture requires: (1) incorporation of land degradation processes, and their linkages with adaptive capacity, into adaptation planning; (2) identification of key vulnerabilities to prioritize adaptation responses; (3) improved knowledge exchange across local to global scales to support strategies for developing the adaptive capacity of producers; and (4) innovative management and policy options that provide multiple “wins” for land, climate, and biodiversity, thus enabling global development and food security goals to be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article  eARIS manuscript 3aagroecology 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afood security 3ainformation exchange 3aissues and policy 3aland degradation 3alivestock 3aplanning 3arisk1 aMarshall, Nadine AeauthoruCSIRO Land and Water, Townsville, Australia1 aStringer, Lindsay CeauthoruSustainability Research Institute, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK1 aReed, Mark SeauthoruInstitute for Agri‐Food Research and Innovation and Centre for Rural Economy, School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK1 aChappell, AdrianeauthoruSchool of Earth and Ocean Sciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK1 aHerrick, Jeffrey EeauthoruUSDA‐ARS Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2017 Oct., v. 15, no. 8 p.450-459dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1540-92957nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2308340uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/58085233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.15303Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:23083b1540-9295c15d8e450  fFrontiers in ecology and the environment  aBatch:1887  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058085239ExL  a2018-02-28  a15409295_2017_15_8.xml  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/17-023.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:1887 reviewed on 2018-02-09T14:00:03Z  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aagid:5808523  a2017-10-03  a2018-02-28  ans1354605620nab a2200877 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098024003000125035002800155040001800183100008300201245013800284300001600422500002000438506002800458506003000486520204300516592002802559593001802587596006602605596006402671596004502735596002702780596007102807596003002878596002802908506003702936650002402973650001202997650001203009650001903021650003303040650001503073650001303088650001203101650001003113650002203123650001203145650001403157650000903171650002303180651002403203651001803227700008003245700009003325700009503415700005803510700011303568700009003681700011303771700012103884773012104005787003304126787001804159787002204177856007304199903002204272912001204294914004404306914002604350916001504376917001104391918004304402935002204445949001504467953005704482954006104539955003404600961001304634962004804647974001704695983001504712984001504727991614197930742620221207134542.0190222e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063139412DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.145342doi7 a10.1111/gcb.145342chorus  aagid:6313941-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalliart, MattheweauthoruBiology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas10aLocal adaptation, genetic divergence, and experimental selection in a foundation grass across the US Great Plains’ climate gradient  ap. 850-868.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aMany prior studies have uncovered evidence for local adaptation using reciprocal transplant experiments. However, these studies are rarely conducted for a long enough time to observe succession and competitive dynamics in a community context, limiting inferences for long‐lived species. Furthermore, the genetic basis of local adaptation and genetic associations with climate has rarely been identified. Here, we report on a long‐term (6‐year) experiment conducted under natural conditions focused on Andropogon gerardii, the dominant grass of the North American Great Plains tallgrass ecosystem. We focus on this foundation grass that comprises 80% of tallgrass prairie biomass and is widely used in 20,000 km² of restoration. Specifically, we asked the following questions: (a) Whether ecotypes are locally adapted to regional climate in realistic ecological communities. (b) Does adaptive genetic variation underpin divergent phenotypes across the climate gradient? (c) Is there evidence of local adaptation if the plants are exposed to competition among ecotypes in mixed ecotype plots? Finally, (d) are local adaptation and genetic divergence related to climate? Reciprocal gardens were planted with 3 regional ecotypes (originating from dry, mesic, wet climate sources) of Andropogon gerardii across a precipitation gradient (500–1,200 mm/year) in the US Great Plains. We demonstrate local adaptation and differentiation of ecotypes in wet and dry environments. Surprisingly, the apparent generalist mesic ecotype performed comparably under all rainfall conditions. Ecotype performance was underpinned by differences in neutral diversity and candidate genes corroborating strong differences among ecotypes. Ecotype differentiation was related to climate, primarily rainfall. Without long‐term studies, wrong conclusions would have been reached based on the first two years. Further, restoring prairies with climate‐matched ecotypes is critical to future ecology, conservation, and sustainability under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cKansas Academy of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011583  cKansas State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007765  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  a2008-35100-04545cUSDA  aGGVP004169.NS9630.3145.50010cGraduate Research Fellowship Program  cKansas Academy of Science  cKansas State University0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAndropogon gerardii 3abiomass 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3aecotypes 3agardens 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agrasses 3aphenotype 3arain 3atallgrass prairies 3aGreat Plains region 3aUnited States1 aBello, NoraeauthoruStatistics, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas1 aKnapp, MaryeauthoruState Climate Office, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas1 aPoland, JesseeauthoruDept of Plant Pathology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas1 aSt Amand, PauleauthoruUSDA‐ARS, Manhattan, Kansas1 aBaer, SaraeauthoruPlant Biology and Center for Ecology, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois1 aMaricle, BrianeauthoruBiological Sciences, Fort Hays State University, Hays, Kansas1 aSmith, Adam B.eauthoruMissouri Botanical Garden, St Louis, Missouri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6420-16591 aJohnson, LorettaeauthoruBiology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8989-77790 tGlobal change biology.g2019 Mar., v. 25, no. 3 p.850-868dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.145343Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c25d3e850  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:2156  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6063139419ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13541013_2019_25_3.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13541013_2019_25_3.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:2156 reviewed on 2019-03-18T14:00:03Z  aagid:6313941  a2019-02-22  a2020-03-0604492nab a2200925 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001900097024002500116024002100141035002600162040001800188072000900206072000900215072000900224072000900233072000900242100002400251245013900275300001800414500002400432500001500456520160600471593001802077593002002095650001802115650001702133650002202150650002102172650000802193650002102201650002102222650002102243650001902264650001302283650002702296650002302323650001802346650002702364650001202391650001902403650003802422650004102460650002302501650004302524650000902567650002402576650001602600650001702616651001102633651001902644651001002663653002402673653001502697700002402712773012002736787001802856787003302874787003002907787002102937852000902958856011202967856007503079912001203154914004403166914002903210917001103239930003303250935002103283945002503304946001303329949001503342952005103357961001303408974001503421984001503436985010303451986001203554991614257840742620221122010302.0101012e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444334682DNAL7 a225464632pmid7 a10.1603/EN093562doi7 a10113/466822hdl  aagid:46682-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aB200 0aL600 0aL001 0aJ2001 aFielding, Dennis J.10aEmbryonic Developmental Rates of Northern Grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae): Implications for Climate Change and Habitat Management  ap. 1643-1651.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAccurate models of temperature-dependent embryonic developmental rates are important to assess the effects of a changing climate on insect life cycles and to suggest methods of population management by habitat manipulation. Embryonic development determines the life cycle of many species of grasshoppers, which, in cold climates, spend two winters in the egg stage. Increasing temperatures associated with climate change in the subarctic could potentiate a switch to a univoltine life cycle. However, egg hatch could be delayed by maintaining a closed vegetative canopy, which would lower soil temperatures by shading the soil surface. Prediapause and postdiapause embryonic developmental rates were measured in the laboratory over a wide range of temperatures for Melanoplus borealis Fieber and Melanoplus sanguinipes F. (Orthoptera: Acrididae) A model was fit to the data and used to predict dates of egg hatch in the spring and prediapause development in the fall under different temperature regimens. Actual soil temperatures were recorded at several locations over 5 yr. To simulate climate warming, 2, 3, or 4°C was added to each hourly recorded temperature. Results suggest that a 2, 3, or 4°C increase in soil temperatures will result in eggs hatching ≈3, 5, or 7 d earlier, respectively. An increase of 3°C would be required to advance prediapause development enough to allow for a portion of the population to be univoltine in warmer years. To simulate shading, 2 and 4°C were subtracted from observed temperatures. A 4°C decrease in temperatures could potentially delay hatch by 8 d.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aoverwintering 3ainsect pests 3asimulation models 3asoil temperature 3aova 3aegg hatchability 3aunivoltine habit 3avegetation cover 3aclimate change 3adiapause 3aMelanoplus sanguinipes 3ainsect development 3aembryogenesis 3alife cycle (organisms) 2aAnimals 2aClimate Change 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aGrasshoppersxembryologyxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aOvumxgrowth & developmentxphysiology 2aSoil 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 0aAlaska 0aArctic Regions 0aIdaho 0aMelanoplus borealis 0aMelanoplus1 aDefoliart, Linda S.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2010 Oct., v.  39, no.  5 p.1643-1651dEntomological Society of Americax0046-225X7nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl3243  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/466823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN093563Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3243b0046-225Xc39d5e1643  fEnvironmental entomology  aissued  a20101227b20110101c00000000  aIND444334689ExL  aINDd2CTe2010/11/03  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20101227 20110101 00000000bIND 2CT 2010/11/03  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:46682  a2015-11-24  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a443346803819nab a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002700133040001800160100019400178245008800372300001400460520179600474592002802270593001802298650001802316650001202334650002502346650001902371650001202390650002202402650002102424650001202445650001102457650001402468650002202482650001902504650001702523650002102540651002302561651001802584700003302602773008302635787003302718787001802751787002202769856004802791912001202839914004302851914001502894917001102909918002902920935002202949949001502971951001502986953003403001961001203035962004803047962004703095962004703142974001603189991614275510742620221120024934.0130322e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006244502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-012-9596-12doi  aagid:417556-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGustafson, Eric J.eauthoruInstitute for Applied Ecosystem Studies, Northern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 5985 Highway K, Rhinelander, Wisconsin, 54501, USA, egustafson@fs.fed.us10aModeling Forest Mortality Caused by Drought Stress: Implications for Climate Change  ap. 60-74.  aClimate change is expected to affect forest landscape dynamics in many ways, but it is possible that the most important direct impact of climate change will be drought stress. We combined data from weather stations and forest inventory plots (FIA) across the upper Great Lakes region (USA) to study the relationship between measures of drought stress and mortality for four drought sensitivity species groups using a weight-of-evidence approach. For all groups, the model that predicted mortality as a function of mean drought length had the greatest plausibility. Model tests confirmed that the models for all groups except the most drought tolerant had predictive value. We assumed that no relationship exists between drought and mortality for the drought-tolerant group. We used these empirical models to develop a drought extension for the forest landscape disturbance and succession model LANDIS-II, and applied the model in Oconto county, Wisconsin (USA) to assess the influence of drought on forest dynamics relative to other factors such as stand-replacing disturbance and site characteristics. The simulations showed that drought stress does affect species composition and total biomass, but effects on age classes, spatial pattern, and productivity were insignificant. We conclude that (for the upper Midwest) (1) a drought-induced tree mortality signal can be detected using FIA data, (2) tree species respond primarily to the length of drought events rather than their severity, (3) the differences in drought tolerance of tree species can be quantified, (4) future increases in drought can potentially change forest composition, and (5) drought is a potentially important factor to include in forest dynamics simulations because it affects forest composition and carbon storage.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aage structure 3abiomass 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3amodels 3amortality 3aspecies diversity 3atree mortality 3awater stress 3aweather stations 3aGreat Lakes region 3aUnited States1 aSturtevant, Brian R.eauthor0 tEcosystems.g2013 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.60-74dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl7003840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-012-9596-1  aArticle  aJournal:jnl70038b1432-9840c16d1e60  fEcosystems  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND5006244509ExL  a2013-12-31  a2013-03-21  aftp_PUB_13-01-24_08-52-21.zip  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:400 annotated on 2013-12-13T14:28:25Z  aBatch:400 reviewed on 2013-12-30T16:00:03Z  aBatch:400 reviewed on 2013-12-31T04:00:03Z  aagid:41755605977nab a2200841 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098035002800136040001800164100011700182245015300299500002200452520202400474592002802498593001802526650004102544650001302585650001602598650000802614650001202622650001902634650002002653650001602673650002302689650002102712650002102733650002002754650001102774650001602785650002302801650001702824651001002841653002602851653001302877653002602890653002702916653002202943700011602965700011903081700012203200700011703322700011703439700013103556700012203687700011003809700012003919700011904039700013504158700011704293773013804410787003304548787001804581787002204599856005104621912001204672914004004684914004504724916001604769917001104785918003604796935002204832949001504854952001904869953009104888954006104979955003505040961001305075974001705088983001505105984001505120991614402530742620221121223617.0221004e20220922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079545392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2022.1074082doi  aagid:7954539-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, XinlineauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China10aEffects of global climate change on the hydrological cycle and crop growth under heavily irrigated management - A comparison between CMIP5 and CMIP6  aPre-press version  aQuantifying the impact of global climate change on the water cycle and crop production is essential for water resource management and agricultural production planning. This study compared multiple GCM (General Circulation Model) projections of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5) and CMIP6 and further used the selected GCMs to quantify the impact of future climate change on hydrology and crop production under intensive irrigation management in the North China Plain using an improved SWAT model (SWAT-MAD). Taylor’s skill score was used firstly to screen out six groups of GCMs with better simulation performance from 10 pairs of homologous GCMs of CMIP5 and CMIP6. The selected GCMs of CMIP5 and CMIP6 were further used to drive SWAT-MAD for a robust evaluation of climate change impacts. Results showed that during winter wheat growing season, average actual evapotranspiration (ETₐ) increased by 3%, 3%, 4%, and 5%, respectively, under 2041-2070 RCP4.5, 2041-2070 SSP2-4.5, 2041-2100 RCP4.5, and 2071-2100 SSP2-4.5 scenarios, compared to the historical period (1971-2000). During summer maize growing season, those changes in ETₐ were 4%, 2%, -0.2%, and -3%. Predicted future precipitation, air temperatures, and surface runoff could increase, while irrigation could decrease as precipitation increased. The dynamic patterns of leaf area index of winter wheat and summer maize indicated that there is a tendency for early emergence and maturity of both crops in the future, and the daily total biomass elevated with a corresponding increase in final yields. The highest increases in yields of winter wheat and summer maize were 18.9% and 16.7%. The findings not only contribute to enhancing the confidence of future projections using CMIP6 but also facilitate our understanding of the relative uncertainty of GCMs. This study provides technical and data support for pre-selections of GCMs and decision making in best management practices for groundwater conservation and agricultural production.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aZea mays 3aagriculture 3aair 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3aelectronics 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic cycle 3airrigation rates 3aleaf area index 3arunoff 3auncertainty 3awater conservation 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aHydrological modeling 0aSWAT-MAD 0aFuture climate change 0aDouble-cropping system 0aIrrigated farming1 aTan, LilieauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China1 aLi, YingxuaneauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China1 aQi, JunyueauthoruEarth System Science Interdisciplinary Center, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20740, USA1 aFeng, PuyueauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China1 aLi, BaoguoeauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China1 aLi Liu, DeeauthoruNSW Department of Primary Industries, Wagga Wagga Agricultural Institute, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia1 aZhang, XueliangeauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China1 aMarek, Gray W.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, TX 79012, USA1 aZhang, YingqieauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China1 aLiu, HaipengeauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China1 aSrinivasan, RaghavaneauthoruDepartment of Ecosystem Science and Management, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA1 aChen, YongeauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Sept. 22,  p.107408-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl3809640uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.107408  aArticle  aJournal:jnl38096b0168-1699e107408  fComputers and electronics in agriculture  aBatch:10266  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6079545399ExL  a2022-10-04  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/222649319265401329-00002-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0168169922007165.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:7954539  a2022-10-04  a2022-10-0404095nab a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003200098035002800130040001800158100013900176245015100315300001800466520143900484536025601923592002802179593001802207650001902225650003202244650002602276650001402302650001302316650001702329650002202346650002002368651001402388653002002402653002402422653002202446700015202468700015602620773012802776787003302904787001802937787002102955856007902976912001203055914004503067914002203112916001603134917001103150918004803161935002203209949001503231952001903246953007003265954005503335955003203390961001203422974001703434983001503451984001503466991614423420742620221120072757.0211210s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075944642DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2021-00972doi  aagid:7594464-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuller, Jacob J.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Resources, University of Minnesota, 1530 Cleveland Avenue N, Saint Paul, MN 55108, USA.10aComparing long-term projected outcomes of adaptive silvicultural approaches aimed at climate change in red pine forests of northern Minnesota, USA  ap. 1875-1887.  aThe Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project was developed to test ecosystem-specific adaptation approaches. The first ASCC trial was installed on the Cutfoot Experimental Forest (CEF) in northern Minnesota, USA, in 2014. Three adaptation treatments (resistance, resilience, and transition), along with a no action control, were tested and compared using Forest Vegetation Simulator to determine their relative success. We compared mean annual increment (MAI) and mortality and determined how well each treatment achieved its species composition and stand structure targets. MAI was highest in the no action (3.77 ± 0.43 m³·ha–¹·year–¹) and lowest in the transition (1.72 ± 0.16 m³·ha–¹·year–¹). However, MAI for the transition treatment continually increased over time, which extended culmination age. The no action control had the highest mortality with 38.76 (±1.32) trees·ha–¹ per 10-year timestep, while the resistance and transition treatments had the lowest levels at 9.36 (±0.49) and 4.19 (±0.35) trees·ha–¹, respectively. Our findings highlight the relative success of the transition, which had lower mortality, greater structural diversity, and a future-climate-adapted species composition. The results from this study provide important context for adaptive silviculture aimed at climate change and offers an example of potential outcomes of these forest adaptation options.  aFunding was provided by the Forest Resources Department and the Cloquet Forestry Center at the University of Minnesota, and the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station.

The purpose of this study was to understand long-term (2000–2013) spatial and temporal variations of ET over the Qinhuai River Basin in a humid region, southern China. We revised the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) by incorporating new algorithms describing hydrological processes of rice paddies. Using the improved SWAT model driven by remote sensing-derived LULCC and local climatic data, we separated the effects of LULCC on ET from climate at the watershed scale. We showed that the modified SWAT model significantly improved monthly streamflow estimates. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) was 0.86 and coefficient of determination (R²) was 0.88 for the calibration period (1990–1994) while the NSE was 0.65 and R² was 0.71 for the validation period (1995–1999). We also found good agreements between modelled daily ET and lysimeter-based measurements for an experimental rice paddy field (R² = 0.75, p less than 0.01). For areas with little land cover change, ET rates increased over time due to the increase in potential ET (PET) during 2000–2013. However, the contribution from rice paddy to the watershed-level ET decreased over time coincident with a period of rapid urbanization and loss of rice paddy field. Dynamic attribution analysis indicated that the negative contribution of LULCC to change in ET increased from 53% in 2000 to 61% in 2013 while the positive contribution of climate variability decreased from 47% in 2000 to 39% in 2013. We concluded that factors affecting ET varied with spatial scale. Conversion of rice paddy field to urban use directly resulted in significant ET reduction at the watershed scale despite the rise in the air temperature and potential ET in the study region. The improved SWAT model provides a better integrated method for understanding ET processes and assessing the impacts of environmental change on ecosystem services in a rapidly urbanizing region.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006959  cChina Meteorological Administration0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aair temperature 3aalgorithms 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aevapotranspiration 3ahumid zones 3ahydrologic cycle 3aland cover 3aland use 3apaddies 3arice 3astream flow 3atemporal variation 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aUrbanization-associated land cover change 0aClimate warming 0aSWAT model 0aEcohydrological processes 0aRice paddy watershed1 aHao, LueauthoruJiangsu Key Laboratory of Agricultural Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2947-19011 aCao, ZheneauthoruJiangsu Key Laboratory of Agricultural Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China1 aHuang, XiaolineauthoruJiangsu Key Laboratory of Agricultural Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China1 aQin, MengshengeauthoruJiangsu Key Laboratory of Agricultural Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China1 aHu, JichaoeauthoruJiangsu Key Laboratory of Agricultural Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China1 aLiu, YongqiangeauthoruCenter for Forest Disturbance Science, Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Athens, GA 30602, USA1 aSun, GeeauthoruEastern Forest Environmental Threat Assessment Center, Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0159-13700 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Aug., v. 587 p.124869-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4653940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1248693Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46539b0022-1694e124869  fJournal of hydrology  aBatch:2470  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6068727049ExL  a2020-05-15  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/651946295747661375-00001-HEAD-ONLY-REVISEDSUBJECTLIST.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0022169420303292.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6872704  a2020-07-24  a2022-10-0403722nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002300115024002700138024002300165024004100188024002500229035002800254040001800282100003500300245013700335520126300472592002801735593001801763593002001781650001501801650001201816650001901828650001101847650003501858650001301893650002101906650001001927650001901937700002801956700019501984773012302179787003302302787001802335787001902353856011402372856007402486912001202560914003602572914001402608917001102622918006702633935002202700949001502722952001902737953006102756954006502817955004102882961001302923962003102936962002002967974001702987979002603004983001503030984001503045991615077830742620221214225307.0220826e20220821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079087662DNAL7 a3963352aris7 a10113/79087662hdl7 a10.3390/d140806902doi7 a3963352seq_no_1157 a6066-21000-001-000D2aris_project_no7 a4369572aris_accn_no  aagid:7908766-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbou-Shaara, Hossam F.eauthor10aTracking the Effects of Climate Change on the Distribution of Plecia nearctica (Diptera, Bibionidae) in the USA Using MaxEnt and GIS  aPlecia nearctica Hardy, commonly referred to as lovebugs, is a species of march fly with a subtropical American distribution. The northern range limits of P. nearctica could alter due to climate change, which is a worldwide issue. It has been reported that flowers utilized by P. nearctica are not visited by pollinators, which may negatively impact foraging activity particularly when resources are limited. This study used 933 occurrence records of P. nearctica in the USA to predict its potential range expansion by 2050. To predict potential habitat change we applied well-established modeling procedures using both MaxEnt and geographical information system (GIS). Six environmental variables, two climate models, and two Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP126 and SSP585) were used in the analysis. The model performance was excellent with a high True Skilled Statistic (=0.75) value. The predicted potential distribution and range expansion of P. nearctica in 2050 includes the Gulf Coast and the Southeastern and Western regions of the USA. However, results suggest that most of the Central and Northern USA are unlikely to provide suitable habitat for this pest and have no reason for concern about interactions between pollinators and P. nearctica.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aBibionidae 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitats 3amodel validation 3apests 3asocioeconomics1 aAmiri, Esmaeil eauthor1 aParys, Katherine A.eauthoruUSDA Agricultural Research Service, Pollinator Health in Southern Crop Ecosystems Research Unit, Stoneville, MS 38776, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7459-36870 tDiversity.g2022 Aug. 21, v. 14, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2167540uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/79087663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d140806903Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:21675b1424-2818c14d8  fDiversity  aissued2 aMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing Instituteeprovider5DNAL  aIND6079087669ExL  a2022-09-01  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/mdpinstitute/diversity-14-08.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/diversity-14-08.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/  aUSDA/ARS  aARIS manuscript submission  aARIS Manuscript  aagid:7908766  aArticle missing pages  a2022-08-26  a2022-09-0105662nab a2200805 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004400098024004100142035002800183040001800211100015400229245013200383300001600515506002800531506003600559506007600595506003100671520173000702592002802432593001802460596004602478596006002524506003702584650004102621650001402662650001202676650001902688650001202707650002002719650001302739650001102752650001102763650001802774650001702792651001902809653002402828653001502852653002002867653003802887653003902925700017802964700015103142700018003293700017603473700019703649700015203846700014403998773011904142787003304261787001804294787002104312856008804333912001204421914004104433914003704474916001504511917001104526918003604537935002204573949001504595953009104610954006104701955003504762961001204797974001704809983001504826984001504841991615166430742620221207125240.0220914e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060985962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.2872chorus7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.2872doi  aagid:6098596-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuttles, Kelly M.eauthoruCenter for Integrated Forest Science, USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, Raleigh, NC, United States of America10aAssessment of hydrologic vulnerability to urbanization and climate change in a rapidly changing watershed in the Southeast U.S.  ap. 806-816.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThis study assessed the combined effects of increased urbanization and climate change on streamflow in the Yadkin-Pee Dee watershed (North Carolina, USA) and focused on the conversion from forest to urban land use, the primary land use transition occurring in the watershed. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to simulate future (2050–2070) streamflow and baseflow for four combined climate and land use scenarios across the Yadkin-Pee Dee River watershed and three subwatersheds. The combined scenarios pair land use change and climate change scenarios together. Compared to the baseline, projected streamflow increased in three out of four combined scenarios and decreased in one combined scenario. Baseflow decreased in all combined scenarios, but decreases were largest in subwatersheds that lost the most forest. The effects of land use change and climate change were additive, amplifying the increases in runoff and decreases in baseflow. Streamflow was influenced more strongly by climate change than land use change. However, for baseflow the reverse was true; land use change tended to drive baseflow more than climate change. Land use change was also a stronger driver than climate in the most urban subwatershed. In the most extreme land use and climate projection the volume of the 1-day, 100 year flood nearly doubled at the watershed outlet. Our results underscore the importance of forests as hydrologic regulators buffering streamflow and baseflow from hydrologic extremes. Additionally, our results suggest that land managers and policy makers need to consider the implications of forest loss on streamflow and baseflow when planning for future urbanization and climate change adaptation options.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDOEdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000015  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000069590 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3abase flow 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aforests 3aland use change 3aplanning 3arivers 3arunoff 3asubwatersheds 3aurbanization 3aNorth Carolina 0aForested watersheds 0aStreamflow 0aLand use models 0aSoil water assessment tool (SWAT) 0aForest management, land use change1 aSingh, Nitin K.eauthoruRubenstein School for Environment and Natural Resources, 617 Main Street, The University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, 05405, United States of America1 aVose, James M.eauthoruCenter for Integrated Forest Science, USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, Raleigh, NC, United States of America1 aMartin, Katherine L.eauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Environmental Resources, North Carolina State University, Campus Box 8008, Raleigh, NC 27695, United States of America1 aEmanuel, Ryan E.eauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Environmental Resources, North Carolina State University, Campus Box 8008, Raleigh, NC 27695, United States of America1 aCoulston, John W.eauthoruForest Inventory and Analysis Program, USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, 1710 Research Center Drive, Blacksburg, VA 24060-6349, United States of America1 aSaia, Sheila M.eauthoruCenter for Integrated Forest Science, USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, Raleigh, NC, United States of America1 aCrump, Michael T.eauthoruMark Twain National Forest, USDA Forest Service, 401 Fairgrounds Road, Rolla, MO 65401, United States of America0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 645 p.806-816dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl445540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.2873Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4455b0048-9697c645e806  fScience of the total environment  aBatch:2065  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6060985969ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/155209357669562851-00001-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0048969718323635.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6098596  a2022-09-14  a2022-09-1404996nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100020100180245013300381300001600514520201700530592002802547593001802575596007502593650001302668650001902681650003002700650001202730650001902742650001902761650001402780650002002794650001302814650001602827650001402843650001302857650001802870650001802888650002602906650000902932650001602941650001002957651001302967700024502980700015803225700012403383700012203507773011303629787003303742787001803775787002103793856008303814912001203897914004403909914002003953916001503973917001103988918002903999935002204028949001504050953006704065954005704132955003704189961001304226974001704239983001504256984001504271991615178620742620221120171153.0210723e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068883222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02627-y2doi  aagid:6888322-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraya, A.eauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, and Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Sustainable Intensification, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA. aberhe@ksu.edu10aPotential impacts of climate change factors and agronomic adaptation strategies on wheat yields in central highlands of Ethiopia  ap. 461-479.  aThe potential impacts of climate change on wheat were assessed for Kulmsa area in central highlands of Ethiopia using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM)—wheat model. The objectives were to (i) evaluate the performance of wheat under increased temperatures with or without changes in rainfall and carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels and (ii) assess the response of different wheat cultivars to projected future climates under improved management practices (optimal nitrogen rate, planting date, and density) (IMPs). The model was first calibrated and used to identify ranges of IMPs. Then, the model was used to (i) conduct sensitivity analysis of wheat in response to assumed elevated temperature (T), with and without change in rainfall and CO₂ level, and to (ii) evaluate average effect of future worst-case climate change scenarios as predicted by an ensemble of three global climate models (GCM) under highest Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP8.5) for three future time frames, NF (2010–2039), MC (2040–2069), and EC (2070–2099). The simulation was evaluated for three wheat cultivars (“early”, “medium”, and “late”) relative to their corresponding baseline values under the selected IMPs. The baseline climate was represented by the long-term (1980–2009) dataset and CO₂ of 360 μmol/mol. Results showed that increased temperature above 4 °C alone had strong negative impacts on yields under the IMPs when CO₂ staying constant at the baseline level. In contrast, climate change simulations with GCM projections under IMPs and elevated CO₂ effect showed that wheat yield remained unchanged (− 0.4 to + 9%) for all three genotypes. This suggests that the IMPs and elevated CO₂ were able to reduce the negative effect of elevated T on wheat yield as T stress did not go beyond optimal T range for wheat. Overall, climate change may not reduce wheat production in the climate of the location of study in the near future, midcentury, or end century.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aAID-OAA-L-14-00006cUnited States Agency for International Development 3aTriticum 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acultivars 3adata collection 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3ahighlands 3anitrogen 3anormal values 3aplanting date 3aproduction technology 3arain 3atemperature 3awheat 3aEthiopia1 aPrasad, P.

This study compares the potential impacts of climate change on future agricultural drought and economic conditions in a rural and an urban congressional district in Northern Virginia (VA). The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model is applied to estimate a soil moisture index (SSI), which is then employed with historic and future climate data to generate SSI predictions. Economic impacts of future SSI changes are inferred from linear regression analysis of the historic relationship between annual mean SSI values and agricultural production values for a seven-year period (2010–2016). The two districts face similar future temperature and precipitation changes due to geographic proximity, but soil moisture, agricultural production and economy-wide responses to climate change differ considerably due to differences in land use and economic structure. In the more rural district, the mean value of drought occurrence increases 38%, while in the more urban district the increase is only 15%. Similarly, economy-wide agricultural sector value added decreases between 17% and 22% in the rural district and between 1 and 5% in the urban district. More studies are required to understand the impacts of adaption on agricultural and other economic sectors both rural and urban regions. More research should be carried out with an application of blue water droughts that have significant impacts to explain the economic impact of droughts.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cInstitute for Critical Technology and Applied Science0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural industry 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aeconomic impact 3aeconomic sectors 3ahydrologic models 3aland use 3ameteorological data 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asoil water 3atemperature 3aurban areas 3avalue added 3aVirginia 0aSoil moisture 0aDrought 0aClimate change 0aAgricultural production 0aEconomic impacts1 aSridhar, VenkataramanaeauthoruDepartment of Biological Systems Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA1 aMills, Bradford F.eauthoruDepartment of Agricultural and Applied Economics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA1 aHession, W.

We determined the relative importance of population dynamics, tree harvest, climate change, and their interaction in affecting tree species distribution changes. LOCATION: Central Hardwood Forest Region of the United States. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Tree species. METHODS: We used a forest dynamic model, LANDIS PRO that accounted for population dynamics, tree harvest, and climate change to predict tree species’ distributions at 270 m resolution from 2000 to 2300. We quantified the relative importance of these factors using a repeated measures analysis of variance. We further investigated the effects of each factor on changes in species distributions by summarizing extinction and colonization rates. RESULTS: On average, population dynamics was the most important factor affecting tree species distribution changes. Tree harvest was more important than climate change by 2100 whereas climate change was more important than harvest by 2300. By end of the 21ˢᵗ century, most tree species expanded their distributions irrespective of any climate or harvest scenario. By 2300, most northern, some southern, and most widely distributed species contracted their distributions while most southern species, some widely distributed species, and few northern species expanded their distributions under warmer climates with tree harvest. Harvest accelerated or ameliorated the contractions and expansions for species that were negatively or positively affected by climate change. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that population dynamics and tree harvest can be more important than climate change and thus should be explicitly included when predicting future tree species’ distributions. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive tree species distributions will enable better predictions of tree species distributions under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUniversity of Missouridhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007165  cU.S.D.A.

A critical assumption for projecting climate change responses is that SDMs are transferable through time, an assumption that is largely untested because investigators often lack temporally independent data for assessing transferability. Further, understanding how the ecology of species influences temporal transferability is critical yet almost wholly lacking. This raises two questions. (1) Are SDM projections transferable in time? (2) Does temporal transferability relate to species ecological traits? To address these questions we developed SDMs for 133 vascular plant species using data from the mountain ranges of California (USA) from two time periods: the 1930s and the present day. We forecast historical models over 75 years of measured climate change and assessed their projections against current distributions. Similarly, we hindcast contemporary models and compared their projections to historical data. We quantified transferability and related it to species ecological traits including physiognomy, endemism, dispersal capacity, fire adaptation, and commonness. We found that non‐endemic species with greater dispersal capacity, intermediate levels of prevalence, and little fire adaptation had higher transferability than endemic species with limited dispersal capacity that rely on fire for reproduction. We demonstrate that variability in model performance was driven principally by differences among species as compared to model algorithms or time period of model calibration. Further, our results suggest that the traits correlated with prediction accuracy in a single time period may not be related to transferability between time periods. Our findings provide a priori guidance for the suitability of SDM as an approach for forecasting climate change responses for certain taxa.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aalgorithms 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ageographical distribution 3aindigenous species 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amountains 3aplant ecology 3aprediction 3areproduction 3aresource management 3avascular plants 3aCalifornia1 aThorne, James H.eauthoruInformation Center for the Environment, University of California, Davis, California 95616 USA1 aGreenberg, Jonathan A.eauthoruCenter for Spatial Technologies and Remote Sensing, University of California, Davis, California 95616 USA1 aSafford, Hugh D.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region, 1323 Club Drive, Vallejo, California 94592 USA1 aMynsberge, Alison R.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Management, College of Forestry and Conservation, 32 Campus Drive, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana 59812 USA1 aCrimmins, Shawn M.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Management, College of Forestry and Conservation, 32 Campus Drive, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana 59812 USA1 aSwanson, Alan K.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Management, College of Forestry and Conservation, 32 Campus Drive, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana 59812 USA0 tEcological monographs.g2011 May, v. 81, no. 2 p.241-257dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1934240uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-1325.13Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:19342b0012-9615c81d2e241  fEcological monographs  aBatch:2277  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6055793819ExL  a2019-08-16  a00129615_2011_81_2.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2277 reviewed on 2019-08-16T14:00:05Z  aagid:5579381  a2016-11-03  a2019-08-1603776nab a2200637 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003300098035002800131040001800159100012000177245010200297300001600399520121000415592002801625593001801653650002001671650002701691650001101718650001201729650001901741650000901760650002501769650001501794650001601809650002201825650001501847650001401862651002301876700011801899700012502017700012302142700011402265700011402379773013102493787003302624787001802657787002202675856007902697912001202776914004402788914005502832916001502887916001502902917001102917918003102928935002202959949001502981953003502996961001203031962004803043974001703091983001503108984001503123991615839980742620221121173059.0160320e20141016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051581752DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2014-00982doi  aagid:5158175-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalke, Jeffrey A.eauthoruDepartment of Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97333, USA.10aClimate change and vulnerability of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in a fire-prone landscape  ap. 304-318.  aLinked atmospheric and wildfire changes will complicate future management of native coldwater fishes in fire-prone landscapes, and new approaches to management that incorporate uncertainty are needed to address this challenge. We used a Bayesian network (BN) approach to evaluate population vulnerability of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in the Wenatchee River basin, Washington, USA, under current and future climate and fire scenarios. The BN was based on modeled estimates of wildfire, water temperature, and physical habitat prior to, and following, simulated fires throughout the basin. We found that bull trout population vulnerability depended on the extent to which climate effects can be at least partially offset by managing factors such as habitat connectivity and fire size. Moreover, our analysis showed that local management can significantly reduce the vulnerability of bull trout to climate change given appropriate management actions. Tools such as our BN that explicitly integrate the linked nature of climate and wildfire, and incorporate uncertainty in both input data and vulnerability estimates, will be vital in effective future management to conserve native coldwater fishes.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aBayesian theory 3aSalvelinus confluentus 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afish 3ahabitat connectivity 3alandscapes 3auncertainty 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3awildfires 3aWashington (state)1 aFlitcroft, Rebecca L.eauthoruPacific Northwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Corvallis, OR, 97333 USA.1 aDunham, Jason B.eauthoruUS Geological Survey, Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center, Corvallis, OR 97333, USA.1 aMcNyset, Kristina M.eauthoruDepartment of Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97333, USA.1 aHessburg, Paul F.eauthoruPacific Northwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Wenatchee, WA 98801, USA.1 aReeves, Gordon H.eauthoruPacific Northwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Corvallis, OR, 97333 USA.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2014 Oct. 16, v. 72, no. 2 p.304-318dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl3208340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2014-00983Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl32083b1205-7533c72d2e304  fCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences  aBatch:1547  aBatch:1777  aissued2 aNRC Canadaeprovider5DNAL  aIND6051581759ExL  a2017-08-11  aCJFASv72i2-01280410-503481.zip  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1777 reviewed on 2017-08-11T16:00:02Z  aagid:5158175  a2016-03-20  a2017-08-1103149nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003600097024002100133035002600154040001800180072000900198072000900207072000900216072000900225072000900234100002500243245014600268300001600414500002400430500001500454520090000469593001801369593002001387650001701407650001701424650002101441650001401462650001101476650001401487650001901501650002101520650001501541651001501556653002401571653001901595700001801614700002401632700002001656700002101676773008001697787001801777787003301795787003001828852000901858856011201867856008601979912001202065914002402077917001102101930003302112935002102145945002502166946001302191949001502204952005102219961001202270974001502282984001502297985010302312986001202415991616064540742620221121025102.0090410e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441888342DNAL7 a0.1016/j.yqres.2006.05.0012doi7 a10113/281182hdl  aagid:28118-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aK250 0aF300 0aF700 0aK0011 aMillar, Constance I.10aLate Holocene forest dynamics, volcanism, and climate change at Whitewing Mountain and San Joaquin Ridge, Mono County, Sierra Nevada, CA, USA  ap. 273-287.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aDeadwood tree stems scattered above treeline on tephra-covered slopes of Whitewing Mtn (3051 m) and San Joaquin Ridge (3122 m) show evidence of being killed in an eruption from adjacent Glass Creek Vent, Inyo Craters.

However, knowledge of how to identify these relationships is still lacking. This study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of water-related ecosystem services and to improve understanding of how they are impacted by land use and climate change in Kentucky, USA. By using InVEST models and environmental setting scenarios, this study first quantifies water-related ecosystem services in a spatially explicit manner. The effects of land use and climate change on these ecosystem services are assessed using two indicators developed in this study. The results show that at the state scale, climate change has a greater impact than land use on water retention, but land use change has a greater impact on soil retention, nitrogen export, and phosphorus export. Climate and land use change have a significant inhibitory effect on water retention, nitrogen export, and phosphorus export. The relative importance and combined influences of land use and climate change also depend on the scale and landscape composition. Unraveling the drivers of ecosystem services in the context of global change can provide critical knowledge for developing practical policy and land management applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental indicators 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asoil 3aKentucky 0aEcosystem service 0aLand use 0aClimate change 0aInVEST 0aKentucky1 aOchuodho, Thomas O.eauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Natural Resources, University of Kentucky, 730 Rose St. Lexington, KY 40546, USA1 aYang, JianeauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Natural Resources, University of Kentucky, 730 Rose St. Lexington, KY 40546, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2170-589X0 tEcological indicators.g2019 July, v. 102 p.51-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)619640uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.01.0793Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/6344335  aArticle  aJournal:6196b1470-160Xc102e51  fEcological indicators  aBatch:2190  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6063443359ExL  a2019-05-01  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/3582-00003-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S1470160X19300974.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1872-7034  aMissing ISSN  aagid:6344335  a2019-04-10  a2022-09-0604021nab a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100017300171245010900344300001800453500002000471520140200491592002801893593001801921650003001939650001201969650001901981650001402000650001202014650002302026650002202049650002402071650001202095650003302107650001102140650002602151650000902177650001502186650002302201650001602224650001602240650001702256700016102273700015502434700015402589773013302743787003302876787001802909787002202927856007302949912001203022914004503034914002803079916001503107917001103122918004303133935002203176949001503198953002703213961001203240962004803252974001703300983001503317984001503332991617153670742620221120171413.0180102e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058759882DNAL7 a10.1890/10-2246.12doi  aagid:5875988-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFord, Chelcy R.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, 3160 Coweeta Lab Road, Otto, North Carolina 28763 USA. crford@fs.fed.us10aCan forest management be used to sustain water‐based ecosystem services in the face of climate change?  ap. 2049-2067.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aForested watersheds, an important provider of ecosystems services related to water supply, can have their structure, function, and resulting streamflow substantially altered by land use and land cover. Using a retrospective analysis and synthesis of long‐term climate and streamflow data (75 years) from six watersheds differing in management histories we explored whether streamflow responded differently to variation in annual temperature and extreme precipitation than unmanaged watersheds. We show significant increases in temperature and the frequency of extreme wet and dry years since the 1980s. Response models explained almost all streamflow variability (adjusted R² > 0.99). In all cases, changing land use altered streamflow. Observed watershed responses differed significantly in wet and dry extreme years in all but a stand managed as a coppice forest. Converting deciduous stands to pine altered the streamflow response to extreme annual precipitation the most; the apparent frequency of observed extreme wet years decreased on average by sevenfold. This increased soil water storage may reduce flood risk in wet years, but create conditions that could exacerbate drought. Forest management can potentially mitigate extreme annual precipitation associated with climate change; however, offsetting effects suggest the need for spatially explicit analyses of risk and vulnerability.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoppicing 3adrought 3aecosystem services 3aforest management 3aforested watersheds 3aforests 3aland use and land cover maps 3amodels 3aretrospective studies 3arisk 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3astream flow 3atemperature 3awater supply1 aLaseter, Stephanie H.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, 3160 Coweeta Lab Road, Otto, North Carolina 28763 USA1 aSwank, Wayne T.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, 3160 Coweeta Lab Road, Otto, North Carolina 28763 USA1 aVose, James M.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, 3160 Coweeta Lab Road, Otto, North Carolina 28763 USA0 tEcological applications.g2011 Sept., v. 21, no. 6 p.2049-2067dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4719340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-2246.13Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl47193b1051-0761c21d6e2049  fEcological applications  aBatch:1910  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058759889ExL  a2018-02-28  a10510761_2011_21_6.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1910 reviewed on 2018-02-28T15:00:02Z  aagid:5875988  a2018-01-02  a2018-02-2805055nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003800098024002200136024001900158035002800177040001800205100013900223245009600362246004500458506007600503520151900579592002802098593001802126506003702144650001102181650001902192650003002211650002502241650001902266650002602285650001502311650001102326650001902337650001902356650002402375650001502399650002302414650001602437650002702453700022002480700017902700700021602879700014103095700021303236700021503449700008103664773007303745787003303818787001803851787002403869856008403893912001203977914004003989914001304029916001504042917001104057918004604068935002204114949001504136953001704151961001304168962004504181962004804226974001704274983001504291984001504306991617188710742620221207103531.0150316e20130819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012162702DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00719212doi7 aPMC37470652pmcid7 a239771802pmid  aagid:1216270-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPendall, EliseeauthoruDepartment of Botany and Program in Ecology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming, United States of America10aWarming Reduces Carbon Losses from Grassland Exposed to Elevated Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide3 aCarbon Cycle Feedbacks to Climate Change  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe flux of carbon dioxide (CO 2) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere may ameliorate or exacerbate climate change, depending on the relative responses of ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration to warming temperatures, rising atmospheric CO 2 , and altered precipitation. The combined effect of these global change factors is especially uncertain because of their potential for interactions and indirectly mediated conditions such as soil moisture. Here, we present observations of CO 2 fluxes from a multi-factor experiment in semi-arid grassland that suggests a potentially strong climate – carbon cycle feedback under combined elevated [CO 2 ] and warming. Elevated [CO 2 ] alone, and in combination with warming, enhanced ecosystem respiration to a greater extent than photosynthesis, resulting in net C loss over four years. The effect of warming was to reduce respiration especially during years of below-average precipitation, by partially offsetting the effect of elevated [CO 2 ] on soil moisture and C cycling. Carbon losses were explained partly by stimulated decomposition of soil organic matter with elevated [CO 2 ]. The climate – carbon cycle feedback observed in this semiarid grassland was mediated by soil water content, which was reduced by warming and increased by elevated [CO 2 ]. Ecosystem models should incorporate direct and indirect effects of climate change on soil water content in order to accurately predict terrestrial feedbacks and long-term storage of C in soil.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aecosystem respiration 3agrasslands 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3asemiarid zones 3asoil organic matter 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atemperature 3aterrestrial ecosystems1 aHeisler-White, Jana L.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service, Rangeland Resources Research Unit and Northern Plains Area, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States of America1 aWilliams, David G.eauthoruDepartments of Botany; Ecosystem Science and Management, and Program in Ecology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming, United States of America1 aDijkstra, Feike A.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service, Rangeland Resources Research Unit and Northern Plains Area, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States of America1 aCarrillo, YolimaeauthoruDepartment of Botany and Program in Ecology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming, United States of America1 aMorgan, Jack A.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service, Rangeland Resources Research Unit and Northern Plains Area, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States of America1 aLeCain, Daniel R.eauthoruUnited States Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service, Rangeland Resources Research Unit and Northern Plains Area, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States of America1 aBernacchi, Carl J.eEditoruUniversity of Illinois, United States of America0 tPloS one.g, v. 8, no. 8dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl427719840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00719213Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4277198b1932-6203c8d8  fPloS one  aBatch:1160  aissued2 aPublic Library of Scienceeprovider5DNAL  aIND6012162709ExL  a2020-03-06  aPLOS_XML.zip  aUSDA/ARS  aIncludes JATS article full-text content.  aBatch:1160 reviewed on 2016-01-06T15:00:02Z  aagid:1216270  a2015-03-16  a2020-03-0606645nab a2200961 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024001700121024003400138024003700172035002800209040001800237100012000255245016700375300001300542506017300555520195600728593001802684593002002702595006202722596004502784593002002829650002202849650002502871650003002896650001202926650001902938650002502957650002002982650002203002650001003024650002503034650002603059650001103085650002703096650002903123650001303152650002503165650002803190650001303218650002603231650002503257650001103282650001303293650001703306651001903323700015903342700010003501700009703601700013903698700010403837700011403941700011004055700009804165700012404263700015504387700011604542700012304658773010304781787003304884787001804917787001904935856011404954856008005068912001205148914003905160914003905199916001505238917001105253935002205264949001505286956010305301961000905404962004705413962004805460974001705508983001505525984001505540985011605555986001205671991617512280742620221214230221.0170609e20170529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057006962DNAL7 a10113/57006962hdl7 a3400762aris7 a10.3389/fenvs.2017.000232doi7 a10.3389/fenvs.2017.000232chorus  aagid:5700696-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaaz, Tai M.eauthoruDepartment of Crop and Soil Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, United States10aImpact of Climate Change Adaptation Strategies on Winter Wheat and Cropping System Performance across Precipitation Gradients in the Inland Pacific Northwest, USA  ap. 1-2-.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aEcological instability and low resource use efficiencies are concerns for the long-term productivity of conventional cereal monoculture systems, particularly those threatened by projected climate change. Crop intensification, diversification, reduced tillage, and variable N management are among strategies proposed to mitigate and adapt to climate shifts in the inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW). Our objectives were to assess these strategies across iPNW agroecological zones and time for their impacts on (1) winter wheat (WW) (Triticum aestivum L.) productivity, (2) crop sequence productivity, and (3) N fertilizer use efficiency. Region-wide analysis indicated that WW yields increased with increasing annual precipitation, prior to maximizing at 520 mm yr−1 and subsequently declining when annual precipitation was not adjusted for available soil water holding capacity. While fallow periods were effective at mitigating low nitrogen (N) fertilization efficiencies under low precipitation, efficiencies declined as annual precipitation exceeded 500 mm yr−1. Variability in the response of WW yields to annual precipitation and N fertilization among locations and within sites supports precision N management implementation across the region. In years receiving <350 mm precipitation yr−1, WW yields declined when preceded by crops rather than summer fallow. Nevertheless, WW yields were greater when preceded by pulses and oilseeds rather than wheat across a range of yield potentials, and when under conservation tillage practices at low yield potentials. Despite the yield penalty associated with eliminating fallow prior to WW, cropping system level productivity was not affected by intensification, diversification, or conservation tillage. However, increased fertilizer N inputs, lower fertilizer N use efficiencies, and more yield variance may offset and limit the economic feasibility of intensified and diversified cropping systems.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  a1361bksichelmanc2017-07-18dmanager-lgarnere2017-07-18  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  eARIS manuscript 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagroecological zones 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconservation tillage 3acrop production 3acropping sequence 3acrops 3aeconomic feasibility 3aenvironmental science 3afallow 3afertilizer application 3afertilizer use reduction 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aoilseeds 3aplant available water 3asoil water retention 3asummer 3avariance 3awinter wheat 3aPacific States1 aSchillinger, William F.eauthoruDepartment of Crop and Soil Sciences, Lind Dryland Research Station, Washington State University, Lind, WA, United States1 aMachado, StepheneauthoruColumbia Basin Agricultural Research Center, Adams, OR, United States1 aBrooks, ErineauthoruBiological Engineering, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, United States1 aJohnson-Maynard, Jodi L.eauthoruDepartment of Plant, Soil and Entomological Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, United States1 aYoung, Lauren E.eauthoruWashington State Crop Improvement Association, Pullman, WA, United States1 aYoung, Frank L.eauthoruNorthwest Sustainable Agroecosystems Research (USDA ARS), Pullman, WA, United States1 aLeslie, IaneauthoruNorthwest Sustainable Agroecosystems Research (USDA ARS), Pullman, WA, United States1 aGlover, AyanaeauthoruBiological Engineering, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, United States1 aMadsen, Isaac J.eauthoruDepartment of Crop and Soil Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, United States1 aEsser, AaroneauthoruDepartment of Crop and Soil Sciences, Lind Research Station, Washington State University Extension, Ritzville, WA, United States1 aCollins, Harold P.eauthoruGrassland, Soil and Water Research Laboratory (USDA ARS), Temple, TX, United States1 aPan, William L.eauthoruDepartment of Crop and Soil Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, United States0 tFrontiers in Environmental Science.g2017 May, v. 5, no. 23 p.1-2-wJournal:26719x2296-665X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2671940uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/57006963Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2017.000233Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:26719b2296-665Xc5d23e1  fFrontiers in Environmental Science  aBatch:1770  aissued  aIND6057006969ExL  a2020-03-06  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/fenvs-05-00023%20%281%29.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission, eISSN 2296-665x  aBatch:1770 reviewed on 2017-07-24T04:00:03Z  aagid:5700696  a2017-06-09  a2020-03-06  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans1258604239nab a2200913 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004200097024002100139035002600160040001800186072000900204100002400213245017600237300001600413500002400429500001500453520131700468593001801785593002001803650003001823650002201853650001501875650002201890650003201912650002201944650001401966650001901980650003101999650002102030650002502051650001302076650001202089650001702101651001102118651001202129651001502141651001102156653002302167653001302190653002902203653001302232653001302245653001902258653001502277653000802292653000802300653001102308700002002319700002602339700002502365700002402390700002302414700002002437773012702457787001802584787003302602787003002635787002102665852000902686856011202695856009202807912001202899914004302911914004602954917001103000930003303011935002103044945002503065946001103090949001503101952005103116961001303167974001503180984001503195985010303210986001203313991617574420742620221123024712.0090228e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441684842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2008.01145.x2doi7 a10113/278662hdl  aagid:27866-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8221 aKOEHLER, ANSON V.A.10aPhylogeography of a Holarctic nematode, Soboliphyme baturini, among mustelids: climate change, episodic colonization, and diversification in a complex host-parasite system  ap. 651-663.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPhylogeography of Soboliphyme baturini, a nematode parasite in mustelids, is explored across Beringia. Sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 4 genes were evaluated from 37 S. baturini, representing 19 localities throughout Alaska, Canada, and Siberia. A total of 30 haplotypes was recovered and maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses support the recognition of a single species with a distribution extending from the Palearctic to the Nearctic. Within S. baturini, a host-specific partition in North America between Martes caurina and Martes americana was not identified. Instead, substantial geographic structure within S. baturini relates to the dynamic geological history of this northern region and especially the North Pacific Coast. Beringia and other coastal refugia along the western margin of North America played a large role during stadial maxima in the persistence and divergence of the parasite. Repeated events for biotic expansion and geographic colonization across the Bering Land Bridge and the Holarctic during glacial maxima in the Pleistocene appear to have facilitated at least two episodes of host-switching of this nematode among mustelids in populations now distributed in eastern Beringia.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3ageographical distribution 3asequence analysis 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3ahost-parasite relationships 3agenetic variation 3aphylogeny 3aclimate change 3aanimal parasitic nematodes 3aMartes americana 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aNematoda 3ageology 3abiogeography 3aCanada 3aSiberia 3aBering Sea 3aAlaska 0aBering Land Bridge 0aBeringia 0aBeringia (Bering Strait) 0aND4 gene 0aCOI gene 0aMartes caurina 0aMustelidae 0aCOI 0aND4 0aMartes1 aHOBERG, ERIC P.1 aDOKUCHAEV, NIKOLAI E.1 aTRANBENKOVA, NINA A.1 aWHITMAN, JACKSON S.1 aNAGORSEN, DAVID W.1 aCOOK, JOSEPH A.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2009 Mar., v.  96, no.  3 p.651-663dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl1847  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/278663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2008.01145.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl1847b0024-4066c96d3e651  fBiological journal of the Linnean Society  aissued  a20090409b20090508c00000000  aIND441684849ExL  aINDdNZMe2009/04/08  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20090409 20090508 00000000bIND NZM 2009/04/08  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:27866  a2009-05-22  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a416848402899nab a2200589 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024001700121024003600138024002500174024004000199024002300239035002800262040001800290100003800308245009400346520103500440593001801475595005601493593002001549650001501569650001901584650001601603650002501619650002101644650002601665650001501691650001501706650001701721700003101738700002501769700002901794700003101823700006401854773007601918787003301994787001802027856008602045912001202131914002302143917001102166935002202177949001502199952001902214961000902233962002002242974001702262983001502279984001502294991618104510742620221214230219.0220311e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076985762DNAL7 a10113/76985762hdl7 a3691162aris7 a10.1038/s41598-020-65094-x2doi7 a4355642aris_accn_no7 a3050-11210-009-00D2aris_project_no7 a3691162seq_no_115  aagid:7698576-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSxhreiner-Mcgraw, Adam P.eauthor10aWoody plant encroachment has a larger impact than climate change on dryland water budgets  aWoody plant encroachment (WPE) into grasslands is a global phenomenon that is associated with land degradation via xerifcation, which replaces grasses with shrubs and bare soil patches. It remains uncertain how the global processes of WPE and climate change may combine to impact water availability for ecosystems. Using a process-based model constrained by watershed observations, our results suggest that both xerifcation and climate change augment groundwater recharge by increasing channel transmission losses at the expense of plant available water. Conversion from grasslands to shrublands without creating additional bare soil, however, reduces transmission losses. Model simulations considering both WPE and climate change are used to assess their relative roles in a late 21st century condition. Results indicate that changes in focused channel recharge are determined primarily by the WPE pathway. As a result, WPE should be given consideration when assessing the vulnerability of groundwater aquifers to climate change.  aPubAg article  a863balice.allenc2022-05-11damanda.xue2022-05-18  eARIS manuscript 3aarid lands 3aclimate change 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3aland degradation 3aplant available water 3ashrublands 3awatersheds 3awoody plants1 aVivoni, Enrique R.eauthor1 aAjami, Hoorieauthor1 aSala, Osvaldo E.eauthor1 aThroop, Heather L.eauthor1 aPeters, P.C.eauthor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5842-80990 tScientific reports.g2020 May 15, v. 10, no. 1 p.8112-x2045-23227nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-65094-x3Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fScientific reports  aissued  aIND6076985769ExL  a2022-03-11  dNAL-AP-2-clean  bUSDA  aARIS Manuscript  aagid:7698576  a2022-03-11  a2022-05-1103471nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003000098035002800128040001800156100010200174245009400276300001600370520146500386592002801851593001801879650002801897650002301925650001901948650002001967650002601987650001402013650001502027650001302042650002302055650002702078650001302105650002202118650001502140653002302155653002602178653002202204653001602226653002902242773010602271787003302377787001802410787002402428856007802452912001202530914004602542914002602588916001502614917001102629918002702640935002202667949001502689953003402704961001202738962004802750974001702798983001502815984001502830991618423210742620221120110459.0151124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012914752DNAL7 a10.3375/043.035.01102doi  aagid:1291475-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilkenny, Francis F.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station Boise, ID 8370210aGenecological Approaches to Predicting the Effects of Climate Change on Plant Populations  ap. 152-164.  aClimate change threatens native plant populations and plant communities globally. It is critical that land managers have a clear understanding of climate change impacts on plant species and populations so that restoration efforts can be adjusted accordingly. This paper reviews the development and use of seed transfer guidelines for restoration in the face of global climate change, with an emphasis on the role of common garden studies in predicting climate change impacts. A method is presented for using genecological common garden data to assess population vulnerability to changing environmental conditions that includes delineation of geographical regions where habitats are likely to become marginal, assessment of shifting climatic selection pressures on plant traits, and identification of source material that is likely to be adapted to changing conditions. This method is illustrated using a genecological dataset for bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata). The demonstration indicates that bluebunch populations will be vulnerable to extirpation in areas of their current range, that selection pressures will increase on a trait important to climatic adaptation, and that promising seed sources exist that may be able to persist under novel conditions. Additional avenues for expansion of the presented methods are discussed, and the use of common garden data for management in the context of evolution and changing climates is considered.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aPseudoroegneria spicata 3aat-risk population 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3aguidelines 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainformation management 3amanagers 3aplant communities 3aprediction 0aassisted migration 0acommon garden studies 0anatural selection 0arestoration 0aseed transfer guidelines0 tNatural areas journal.g2015 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.152-164dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl407868940uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F043.035.01103Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4078689b0885-8608c35d1e152  fNatural areas journal  aBatch:1392  aissued2 aBioOneeprovider5DNAL  aIND6012914759ExL  a2016-08-09  aNAARv35i1-01270053-427682.zip  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1392 reviewed on 2016-08-09T04:00:03Z  aagid:1291475  a2015-11-24  a2016-08-0902206nab a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008003300034016002200067024002100089035002600110040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100002300181245013100204500002400335593001800359594002200377650003400399650001900433650002400452650003900476650002200515650001100537650002900548650001500577651001200592773028400604787001800888787003300906856011200939912001201051914025301063917001101316930003301327935002101360945002501381946001101406949001501417952005101432961001301483974001501496979002301511984001501534985010301549986001201652991618540330742620221123020000.0110118|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND444756102DNAL7 a10113/475322hdl  aagid:47532-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aA500 0aB200 0aP2001 aGoodrich, David C.13aAn overview of the USDA-ARS climate change and hydrology program and analysis of model complexity as a function of basin scale  aIncludes references  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article 3aAgricultural Research Service 3aclimate change 3awatershed hydrology 3agovernmental programs and projects 3ahydrologic models 3arunoff 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aarid lands 3aArizona0 tProceedings of the Workshop on the Effects of Global Climate Change on Hydrology and Water Resources at the Catchment Scale, February 3-6, 1992, Tsukuba, Japan / Japan-U.S. Committee on Hydrology, Water Resources, and Global Climate Change (JUCHWR).dThe Committee, [1992.]7nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/475323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  fProceedings of the Workshop on the Effects of Global Climate Change on Hydrology and Water Resources at the Catchment Scale, February 3-6, 1992, Tsukuba, Japan / Japan-U.S. Committee on Hydrology, Water Resources, and Global Climate Change (JUCHWR)  aissued  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aIND444756109ExL  aINDdGAYe2011/02/03  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20110205 20110305 00000000bIND GAY 2011/02/03  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:47532  aMissing Issue date  a2011-03-05  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a447561004088nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002100115024003000136035002600166040001800192100002700210245009400237300001600331506017300347520142700520593001801947593002001965593002001985650001402005650001902019650003002038650001502068650001202083650002002095650001502115650001302130650002602143650001902169650002502188650001902213650001502232700002902247700002902276700003102305700002902336700003102365700002902396773011102425787003302536787001802569787003002587787001902617856011202636856004302748912001202791914002602803914002602829917001102855935002202866949001502888956008602903961000902989962003002998962004803028962004703076962004703123974001503170983001503185984001503200985011603215986001103331991585709190742620221214225313.0140509e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008944472DNAL7 a2708132aris7 a10113/587692hdl7 a10.1038/NCLIMATE15732doi  aagid:58769-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFay, Philip A.eauthor10aSoil-mediated effects of subambient to increased carbon dioxide on grassland productivity  ap. 742-746.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aGrasslands are structured by climate and soils1,2, and are increasingly affected by anthropogenic changes, including rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations3,4. CO2 enrichment can alter grassland ecosystem function both directly and through indirect, soil-specific effects on moisture, nitrogen availability and plant species composition5–8, potentially leading to threshold change in ecosystem properties9. Here we show that the increase in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) with CO2 enrichment depends strongly on soil type. We found that the ANPP–CO2 response of grassland was 2:5x greater on two soils with higher plant-available soil moisture and where direct CO2 effects on ANPP were accompanied by indirect CO2 effects on ANPP mediated through an increase in soil moisture or increased dominance of a productive C4 grass. Indirect CO2 effects on ANPP were absent on a third soil that was less responsive to CO2 (1:6). Unexpectedly6,10, soil N availability changed little with CO2 and did not seem to drive responses in ANPP. On the more responsive soils, the more productive grass C4 was favoured with CO2 enrichment because of greater photosynthetic efficiency. Our results enhance present models of the controls on ecosystem responses to CO2 (refs 7,8,11) and demonstrate mechanisms by which soils could cause spatial variation in CO2 effects on ANPP and other ecosystem attributes.

Consequently, there is limited research of their integrated effects on water supply systems, and even fewer studies that rigorously account for infrastructure investment and management interventions. We utilize ecohydrologic modeling to generate watershed outflows under scenarios of climate and land cover change, which in turn drive modeled water utility‐level decision making for the Research Triangle region of North Carolina. In the Triangle region, land cover and climate change are both likely to increase water supply availability (reservoir inflows) individually and in tandem. However, improvements from water supply increases are not uniform across management system performance indicators of reliability, conservation implementation frequency (i.e., water use restrictions), and infrastructure investment. Utility decisions influence the impact of hydrologic change through both short‐term (e.g., use restrictions and water transfers) and longer‐term infrastructure investment actions, in some cases offsetting the beneficial effects of additional water supply. Timing and sequencing of infrastructure development are strongly sensitive to climate and land use change as captured by their impacts on utility performance outcomes. This work underscores the need to consider adaptive management system responses and decision‐relevant performance measures when determining the impacts of hydrologic change on water availability.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a1360442cNational Science Foundation 3aadaptive management 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ainfrastructure 3aland cover 3aland use change 3amanagement systems 3aresearch 3awater 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aNorth Carolina1 aLin, L.eauthoruInstitute for the Environment, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA1 aZeff, H.

Stomatal opening responds to internal concentrations of CO₂ in the leaf, but changing CO₂ can also lead to changes in stomatal density that influence transpiration. Given that stomatal conductance increases under subambient concentrations of CO₂ and, conversely, that plants lose less water at elevated concentrations, can downstream effects of atmospheric CO₂ be observed in xylem tissue? We approached this problem by evaluating leaf stomatal density, xylem transport, xylem anatomy and resistance to cavitation in Helianthus annuus plants grown under three CO₂ regimes ranging from pre‐industrial to elevated concentrations. Xylem transport, conduit size and stomatal density all increased at 290 ppm relative to ambient and elevated CO₂ concentrations. The shoots of the 290‐ppm‐grown plants were most vulnerable to cavitation, whereas xylem cavitation resistance did not differ in 390‐ and 480‐ppm‐grown plants. Our data indicate that, even as an indirect driver of water loss, CO₂ can affect xylem structure and water transport by coupling stomatal and xylem hydraulic functions during plant development. This plastic response has implications for plant water use under variable concentrations of CO₂, as well as the evolution of efficient xylem transport.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aIOS‐1027410cNSF  eARIS manuscript 3astomatal movement 3acarbon dioxide 3aplant development 3aHelianthus annuus 3astomatal conductance 3aevolution 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3agas exchange 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aclimate change 3aplant response 3astomata 3axylem 3ashoots1 aPittermann, JarmilaeauthoruDepartment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, 95064, USA1 aPolley, H.

Wildfire can catalyze vegetation change by killing adult trees that could otherwise persist in climate conditions no longer suitable for seedling establishment and survival. Recently documented declines in postfire conifer recruitment in the western United States may be an example of this phenomenon. However, the role of annual climate variation and its interaction with long-term climate trends in driving these changes is poorly resolved. Here we examine the relationship between annual climate and postfire tree regeneration of two dominant, low-elevation conifers (ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir) using annually resolved establishment dates from 2,935 destructively sampled trees from 33 wildfires across four regions in the western United States. We show that regeneration had a nonlinear response to annual climate conditions, with distinct thresholds for recruitment based on vapor pressure deficit, soil moisture, and maximum surface temperature. At dry sites across our study region, seasonal to annual climate conditions over the past 20 years have crossed these thresholds, such that conditions have become increasingly unsuitable for regeneration. High fire severity and low seed availability further reduced the probability of postfire regeneration. Together, our results demonstrate that climate change combined with high severity fire is leading to increasingly fewer opportunities for seedlings to establish after wildfires and may lead to ecosystem transitions in low-elevation ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests across the western United States.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cJoint Fire Science Program  cNASA  cNSF  cNSF  cNSF  cUSDA | National Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus ponderosa 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aadults 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aconifers 3aecosystems 3afire severity 3aplant establishment 3aprobability 3asoil water 3asurface temperature 3atrees 3avapor pressure deficit 3awildfires1 aDobrowski, Solomon Z.eauthoruDepartment of Forest Management, University of Montana, USA1 aHiguera, Philip E.eauthoruDepartment of Ecosystem and Conservation Sciences, University of Montana, USA1 aHolden, Zachary A.eauthoruUS Forest Service Region 1, USA1 aVeblen, Thomas T.eauthoruDepartment of Geography, University of Colorado, USA1 aRother, Monica T.eauthoruDepartment of Geography, University of Colorado; Department of Environmental Sciences, University of North Carolina, USA1 aParks, Sean A.eauthoruAldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, Rocky Mountain Research Station, US Forest Service, USA1 aSala, AnnaeauthoruDivision of Biological Sciences, University of Montana, USA1 aManeta, Marco P.eauthoruDepartment of Geosciences, University of Montana, USA0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.g2019 Mar. 26, v. 116, no. 13 p.6193-6198dProceedings of the National Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4568040uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.18151071163Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl45680c116d13e6193  fProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  aBatch:10133  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073446959ExL  a2021-06-16  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1091-6490  aagid:7344695  a2022-09-01T12:46:12-04:00  a2022-10-05  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl04432nab a2200637 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002800098035002800126040001800154100014500172245006500317300001300382500001100395520169100406592002802097593001802125596007102143596005902214650002402273650001702297650001202314650001902326650001202345650001502357650002902372650002102401650001702422650001302439650002402452700017302476700012702649700017802776700015502954773012703109787003303236787001803269787002203287856007503309912001203384914004203396914003503438917001103473918004303484935002203527949001503549952001903564953005703583954006103640955003403701961001203735974001703747983001503764984001503779991585824880742620221119095059.0220808e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078717572DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.219692doi  aagid:7871757-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLEDee, Olivia E.eauthoruU.S. Geological Survey, Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center, 1992 Folwell Avenue, St. Paul, MN, 55116, USA10aPreparing Wildlife for Climate Change: How Far Have We Come?  ap. 7-16.  aREVIEW  aGlobal biodiversity is in unprecedented decline and on‐the‐ground solutions are imperative for conservation. Although there is a large volume of evidence related to climate change effects on wildlife, research on climate adaptation strategies is lagging. To assess the current state of knowledge in climate adaptation, we conducted a comprehensive literature review and evaluated 1,346 peer‐reviewed publications for management recommendations designed to address the consequences of climate change on wildlife populations. From 509 publications, we identified 2,306 recommendations and employed both qualitative and quantitative methods for data analysis. Although we found an increase in the volume and diversity of recommendations since 2007, a focus on protected areas (26%, 596 of 2,306 recommendations) and the non‐reserve matrix (12%, 276 of 2,306 recommendations) remained prominent in the climate adaptation literature. Common concepts include protected areas, invasive species, ecosystem services, adaptive management, stepping stones, assisted migration, and conservation easements. In contrast, only 1% of recommendations focused on reproduction (n = 26), survival (n = 14), disease (n = 26), or human‐wildlife conflict (n = 24). Few recommendations reflected the potential for local‐scale management interventions. We demonstrate limited advancement in preparing natural resource managers in climate adaptation at local, management‐relevant scales.

Despite living entirely on federal lands, it has recently faced severe extirpations, yet our understanding of climatic influences on population connectivity is limited. In this study, we used a previously published double-digest RADseq dataset along with numerous remotely sensed habitat features in a landscape genetics framework to answer two primary questions in Yosemite National Park: (1) Which fine-scale climate, topographic, soil, and vegetation features most facilitate meadow connectivity? (2) How is climate change predicted to influence both the magnitude and net asymmetry of genetic migration? We developed an approach for simultaneously modeling multiple toad migration paths, akin to circuit theory, except raw environmental features can be separately considered. Our workflow identified the most likely migration corridors between meadows and used the unique cubist machine learning approach to fit and forecast environmental models of connectivity. We identified the permuted modeling importance of numerous snowpack-related features, such as runoff and groundwater recharge. Our results highlight the importance of considering phylogeographic structure, and asymmetrical migration in landscape genetics. We predict an upward elevational shift for this already high-elevation species, as measured by the net vector of anticipated genetic movement, and a north-eastward shift in species distribution via the network of genetic migration corridors across the park.  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aAnaxyrus 3aasymmetry 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ageographical distribution 3agroundwater recharge 3ahabitats 3ainheritance (genetics) 3alandscape genetics 3ameadows 3amountains 3anational parks 3aphylogeography 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3asoil 3atoads 3atopography 3aCalifornia1 aVandergast, AmyeauthoruU.S. Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, San Diego Field Station, San Diego, CA, 92101, USA1 aOstoja, Steven MuireauthoruUSDA California Climate Hub, Agricultural Research Service, John Muir Institute of the Environment, University of California, Davis, 1 Shields Ave., Davis, CA, 95616, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9182-44131 aAguilar, AndreseauthoruDepartment of Biological Sciences, California State University, Los Angeles, 5151 State University Dr., Los Angeles, CA, 90032, USA1 aBohonak, AndreweauthoruDepartment of Biology, San Diego State University, 5500 Campanile Dr., San Diego, CA, 92182, USA0 tHeredity.g2022 Sept. 8, wJournal:1939x0018-067X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)193940uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41437-022-00561-x3Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:1939b0018-067X  fHeredity  aissued  aIND6079520059ExL  a2022-10-05  dNAL-AP-2-clean  bUSDA  aagid:7952005  amissing vol and no  a2022-10-03  a2022-10-0413292nab a2201549 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002300115024002700138024002300165024004000188024002500228035002800253040001800281100012500299245011300424300001800537500001500555500002000570520211300590592002802703593001802731595005602749593002002805650001302825650002002838650001902858650003002877650002102907650000902928650001602937650002102953650001902974650001602993650001803009650002003027650002103047650002503068650002603093650002403119650001403143650000903157650001903166650002303185650001903208651001003227651001303237651001003250651000903260651001103269700011803280700011403398700008503512700011303597700020403710700019103914700013904105700017604244700012004420700006404540700016704604700011404771700016104885700015205046700010705198700016205305700009705467700005405564700018405618700018805802700021505990700010606205700014206311700014306453700017906596700017606775700008306951700011707034700016007151700011507311700014407426700014107570700015107711700011407862700016007976700011808136700013608254700016908390700015708559700013608716700005108852700011408903700015609017700009409173700009909267700016009366700016209526700014509688700013709833700022809970700015610198700014510354700008410499700014810583700013910731773012410870787003310994787001811027787002211045856011411067856007411181912001211255914003511267914002611302916001611328916001611344917001111360918004311371935002211414949001511436953005811451954006211509955003411571961001311605962003011618962004711648974001711695983001511712984001511727991586507960742620221214224414.0200928e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070712312DNAL7 a3713622aris7 a10113/70712312hdl7 a10.1111/gcb.152612doi7 a3713622seq_no_1157 a6066-13000-005-00D2aris_project_no7 a4324742aris_accn_no  aagid:7071231-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalconnier, Gatien N.eauthoruAIDA, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Montpellier, France1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3291-650X10aModelling climate change impacts on maize yields under low nitrogen input conditions in sub‐Saharan Africa  ap. 5942-5964.  agolden set  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSmallholder farmers in sub‐Saharan Africa (SSA) currently grow rainfed maize with limited inputs including fertilizer. Climate change may exacerbate current production constraints. Crop models can help quantify the potential impact of climate change on maize yields, but a comprehensive multimodel assessment of simulation accuracy and uncertainty in these low‐input systems is currently lacking. We evaluated the impact of varying [CO₂], temperature and rainfall conditions on maize yield, for different nitrogen (N) inputs (0, 80, 160 kg N/ha) for five environments in SSA, including cool subhumid Ethiopia, cool semi‐arid Rwanda, hot subhumid Ghana and hot semi‐arid Mali and Benin using an ensemble of 25 maize models. Models were calibrated with measured grain yield, plant biomass, plant N, leaf area index, harvest index and in‐season soil water content from 2‐year experiments in each country to assess their ability to simulate observed yield. Simulated responses to climate change factors were explored and compared between models. Calibrated models reproduced measured grain yield variations well with average relative root mean square error of 26%, although uncertainty in model prediction was substantial (CV = 28%). Model ensembles gave greater accuracy than any model taken at random. Nitrogen fertilization controlled the response to variations in [CO₂], temperature and rainfall. Without N fertilizer input, maize (a) benefited less from an increase in atmospheric [CO₂]; (b) was less affected by higher temperature or decreasing rainfall; and (c) was more affected by increased rainfall because N leaching was more critical. The model intercomparison revealed that simulation of daily soil N supply and N leaching plays a crucial role in simulating climate change impacts for low‐input systems. Climate change and N input interactions have strong implications for the design of robust adaptation approaches across SSA, because the impact of climate change in low input systems will be modified if farmers intensify maize production with balanced nutrient management.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a616balice.allenc2020-08-20damanda.xue2020-08-21  eARIS manuscript

factors directly influencing catchment hydrology, and separation of their effects is of great importance for land use planning and water resources management. Using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tools) model, we assessed the impacts of land use change and climate variability on surface hydrology (runoff, soil water and evapotranspiration) in an agricultural catchment on the Loess Plateau of China. Results indicated that SWAT proved to be a powerful tool to simulate the effect of environmental change on surface hydrology. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Ens), Percent bias (PBIAS) and ratio of root mean square error to measured standard deviation (RSR) for annual flow was 0.87, 4.0%, 0.36 during calibration period and 0.87, 2.5%, 0.36 during validation periods, respectively. During 1981-2000, about 4.5% of the catchment area was changed mainly from shrubland and sparse woodland to medium and high grassland, and climate changed to warmer and drier. The integrated effects of the land use change and climate variability decreased runoff, soil water contents and evapotranspiration. Both land use change and climate variability decreased runoff by 9.6% and 95.8%, respectively, and decreased soil water contents by 18.8% and 77.1%. Land use change increased evapotranspiration by 8.0% while climate variability decreased it by 103.0%. The climate variability influenced the surface hydrology more significantly than the land use change in the Heihe catchment during 1981-2000; therefore, the influence of climate variability should be considered and assessed separately when quantifying the hydrological effect of vegetation restoration in the Loess Plateau.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aland use change 3ashrublands 3aevapotranspiration 3aagricultural runoff 3aair temperature 3aclimatic factors 3aglobal warming 3awatershed hydrology 3asoil water 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3awoodlands 3agrasslands 3aagricultural watersheds 3aChina 0aprecipitation 0aclimate change1 aLiu, Wen-zhao1 aZhang, Xun-chang1 aZheng, Fen-li0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Oct. 20, v.  377, no.  1-2 p.35-42dElsevierx0022-16947nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl46539  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/350083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.08.0073Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46539b0022-1694c377d1-2e35  fJournal of hydrology  aissued  a20091021b20091106c00000000  aIND442674449ExL  aINDdRHFe2009/10/20  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20091021 20091106 00000000bIND RHF 2009/10/20  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:35008  a2009-11-07  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a426744403871nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001900097024002000116024003000136035002500166040001800191100002700209245008400236300001800320500000900338520146500347592002801812593001801840650002501858650001201883650002601895650001101921650001801932650002201950650001801972650001901990650002102009650005102030650001202081650004902093650001402142650002402156650001402180650002402194650001702218651001802235700002702253773019402280787001802474787003302492787003002525787002102555852000902576856011102585856007702696912001202773914004402785914003702829917001102866918002702877935002102904949001502925953005102940954005502991955003503046961001203081974001403093983001503107984001503122986001203137991586664490742620221119095721.0191028e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438519342DNAL7 a168254592pmid7 a10113/39022hdl7 a10.2134/jeq2005.01542doi  aagid:3902-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlig, Ralph J.eauthor10aForest Environmental Investments and Implications for Climate Change Mitigation  ap. 1389-1395.  aepub  aForest environmental conditions are affected by climate change, but investments in forest environmental quality can be used as part of the climate change mitigation strategy. A key question involving the potential use of forests to store more carbon as part of climate change mitigation is the impact of forest investments on the timing and quantity of forest volumes that affect carbon storage. Using an economic optimization model, we project levels of U.S. forest volumes as indicators of carbon storage for a wide range of private forest investment scenarios. Results show that economic opportunities exist to further intensify timber management on some hectares and reduce the average timber rotation length such that the national volume of standing timber stocks could be reduced relative to projections reflecting historical trends. The national amount of timber volume is projected to increase over the next 50 yr, but then is projected to decline if private owners follow an economic optimization path, such as with more forest type conversions and shorter timber rotations. With perfect foresight, future forest investments can affect current timber harvest levels, with intertemporal linkages based on adjustments through markets. Forest investments that boost regenerated timber yields per hectare would act to enhance ecosystem services (e.g., forest carbon storage) if they are related to the rate of growth and extent of growing stock inventory.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3acarbon sequestration 3aforests 3aenvironmental factors 3amodels 3aforest yields 3atimber management 3atimber

precipitation will induce changes in the erosive power of rainfall and hence changes in soil erosion rates. In this study we calculated downscaled mean annual precipitation and USLE rainfall erosivity (R) for time periods 2030 through 2059 and 2070 through 2099 in Northeast China using future precipitation predicted from six GCM models under three emissions scenarios. To accomplish this we created a new approach wherein we combined the well evaluated methods developed by Zhang (2005,2007) for downscaling monthly precipitation products at time scales meaningful for modeling erosion processes, and the validated method developed by Yu (2002,2003) for using a weather generator (CLIGEN) to generate accurate RUSLE erosivity factors. Changes were compared to 1960 through 1999 conditions. A stochastic weather generator (CLIGEN) calibrated to precipitation for the period 1960 through 1999 was used to temporally downscale the GCM output, from which the future R values were calculated. Our results suggested a general increase in erosivity over the region by the mid-21st century. Changes in rainfall erosivity under the higher greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, A1B and A2, exhibited the greatest projected changes. The results also indicated that changes in total annual rainfall amounts were not uniformly correspondent spatially to changes in erosivity. Multimodel means showed a generally larger increase in the northern portion of the region than that in the southern part. Future rainfall erosivity changes will have important impacts on soil and water resources in Northeastern China.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aclimate change 3arain 3aUniversal Soil Loss Equation 3awater erosion 3aChina 0aprecipitation 0aerosivity1 aNearing, M.A.1 aZhang, X.-C.1 aXie, Y.1 aWei, H.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2010 Apr. 15, v.  384, no.  1-2 p.97-106dElsevierx0022-16947nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl46539  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/397333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.01.0133Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46539b0022-1694c384d1-2e97  fJournal of hydrology  aissued  a20100325b20100403c00000000  aIND443383779ExL  aINDdRHFe2010/03/25  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20100325 20100403 00000000bIND RHF 2010/03/25  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:39733  a2010-04-03  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a433837701354nab a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075035002800097040001800125072001700143072001700160100001800177245008800195300001100283650001900294650001700313650001500330650002200345650002100367650003100388773006700419787003300486787001900519852000900538912001200547914002200559914001300581917001100594930003300605935002100638945002500659946001300684952005100697961001300748974001700761984001500778985010300793986001200896991587550970742620221119102603.0080523e200012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440592282DNAL  aagid:3988844-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The current study found that conditions in the south-eastern US will likely become drier overall, given a warmer environment during future winter and spring seasons. This study examined the potential effects of a warmer climate in the 21st century on relevant meteorological fire parameters (e.g. total and convective precipitation, 500-hPa geopotential heights, near-surface relative humidity) and popular fire indices (e.g. Haines and Keetch–Byram Drought Indices) in the south-eastern US. Although the results offered conflicting implications in portions of the study domain, the southern half of the south-eastern US (including the Deep South, the southern Piedmont and Florida) exhibited the highest potential for increasing fire activity in the mid-21st century, given maximum warming and drying in these areas, especially in the spring season.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3apiedmont 3arelative humidity 3aspring 3atemperature 3awinter 3aFlorida 0aforest fires 0aHaines Index 0aKBDI1 aMote, Thomas L.uUniversity of Georgia, 210 Field Street, Room 204, Athens, GA 30602, USA.1 aGoodrick, Scott L.uUnited States Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Center for Forest Disturbance Science, 320 Green Street, Athens, GA 30602, USA.0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2013, v. 22, no. 8 p.1034-1043dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5753440uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF13018  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57534b1049-8001c22d8e1034  fInternational journal of wildland fire  aissued2 aCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)eprovider5DNAL  aIND5007109889ExL  a2013-12-30  a2013-12-02  aWF_22_8.ZIP  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:397 annotated on 2013-12-13T10:47:02Z  aBatch:397 reviewed on 2013-12-30T11:00:03Z  aBatch:397 reviewed on 2013-12-30T16:00:03Z  aagid:615655  a2013-12-02  a2013-12-0205174nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002600098035002800124040001800152100011700170245006000287300001600347500001900363500002000382520119300402592002801595593001801623596004301641596006401684596004001748596002701788650001701815650001201832650001901844650001501863650001601878650002001894650001901914700011701933700010602050700010302156700017902259700010702438700015502545700011302700700009102813700016202904700011403066700011403180700010103294700010003395700010503495700012103600773013703721787003303858787001803891787001903909856007203928912001204000914004104012914004504053916001604098917001104114918004304125935002204168949001504190953005704205954006104262955003404323961001204357974001704369983001504386984001504401991587962480742620221119080126.0200602e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069721332DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.21892doi  aagid:6972133-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorelli, Toni LyneauthoruNortheast Climate Adaptation Science Center, US Geological Survey (USGS), Amherst, MA10aClimate‐change refugia: biodiversity in the slow lane  ap. 228-234.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate‐change adaptation focuses on conducting and translating research to minimize the dire impacts of anthropogenic climate change, including threats to biodiversity and human welfare. One adaptation strategy is to focus conservation on climate‐change refugia (that is, areas relatively buffered from contemporary climate change over time that enable persistence of valued physical, ecological, and sociocultural resources). In this Special Issue, recent methodological and conceptual advances in refugia science will be highlighted. Advances in this emerging subdiscipline are improving scientific understanding and conservation in the face of climate change by considering scale and ecosystem dynamics, and looking beyond climate exposure to sensitivity and adaptive capacity. We propose considering refugia in the context of a multifaceted, long‐term, network‐based approach, as temporal and spatial gradients of ecological persistence that can act as “slow lanes” rather than areas of stasis. After years of discussion confined primarily to the scientific literature, researchers and resource managers are now working together to put refugia conservation into practice.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUS Department of the Interior National  cNortheast, and Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Centers  cUniversity of California–Berkeley  cWilburforce Foundation 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3arefuge habitats 3asocial welfare1 aBarrows, Cameron WeauthoruCenter for Conservation Biology, University of California–Riverside, Riverside, CA1 aRamirez, Aaron ReauthoruDepartment of Biology and Environmental Studies, Reed College, Portland, OR1 aCartwright, Jennifer MeauthoruLower Mississippi–Gulf Water Science Center, USGS, Nashville, TN1 aAckerly, David DeauthoruDepartment of Integrative Biology and Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California–Berkeley, Berkeley, CA1 aEaves, Tatiana DeauthoruKrieger School of Arts and Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD1 aEbersole, Joseph LeauthoruPacific Ecological Systems Division, Office of Research and Development, US Environmental Protection Agency, Corvallis, OR1 aKrawchuk, Meg AeauthoruDepartment of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR1 aLetcher, Benjamin HeauthoruConte Anadromous Fish Laboratory, USGS, Turners Falls, MA1 aMahalovich, Mary FeauthoruNorthern, Rocky Mountain, Southwestern, and Intermountain Regions, US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, Moscow, ID1 aMeigs, Garrett WeauthoruDepartment of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR1 aMichalak, Julia LeauthoruSchool of Environmental and Forest Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA1 aMillar, Constance IeauthoruPacific Southwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Albany, CA1 aQuiñones, Rebecca MeauthoruMassachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, Westborough, MA1 aStralberg, DianaeauthoruDepartment of Renewable Resources, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada1 aThorne, James HeauthoruDepartment of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California–Davis, Davis, CA0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2020 June, v. 18, no. 5 p.228-234dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2308340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.21893Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:23083b1540-9295c18d5e228  fFrontiers in ecology and the environment  aBatch:10091  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6069721339ExL  a2021-04-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/15409295_2020_18_5.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/15409295_2020_18_5.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:6972133  a2020-06-02  a2021-04-1805145nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002600098035002800124040001800152100017500170245011200345500002000457520202400477592002802501593001802529596003502547596002702582596003502609596002702644596004102671596005302712596007702765596005802842650002202900650001202922650001202934650002202946650001502968650001402983650001402997650001403011650002803025650001603053650001403069651001803083700016403101700016303265700017603428700012603604773012303730787003303853787001803886787002203904856007303926912001203999914004704011914002804058916001604086917001104102918004304113935002204156949001504178952001904193953005704212954006104269955003404330961001204364974001704376983001504393984001504408991587982460742620221119080304.0211202e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075876792DNAL7 a10.1002/eap.24322doi  aagid:7587679-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHessburg, Paul F.eauthoruUSDA‐FS, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 1133 N.

Resulting interactions between historical increases in forested area and density and recent rapid warming, increasing insect mortality, and wildfire burned areas, are now leading to substantial abrupt landscape alterations. These outcomes are forcing forest planners and managers to identify strategies that can modify future outcomes that are ecologically and/or socially undesirable. Past forest management, including widespread harvest of fire‐ and climate‐tolerant large old trees and old forests, fire exclusion (both Indigenous and lightning ignitions), and highly effective wildfire suppression have contributed to the current state of wNA forests. These practices were successful at meeting short‐term demands, but they match poorly to modern realities. Hagmann et al. review a century of observations and multi‐scale, multi‐proxy, research evidence that details widespread changes in forested landscapes and wildfire regimes since the influx of European colonists. Over the preceding 10 millennia, large areas of wNA were already settled and proactively managed with intentional burning by Indigenous tribes. Prichard et al. then review the research on management practices historically applied by Indigenous tribes and currently applied by some managers to intentionally manage forests for resilient conditions. They address 10 questions surrounding the application and relevance of these management practices. Here, we highlight the main findings of both papers and offer recommendations for management. We discuss progress paralysis that often occurs with strict adherence to the precautionary principle; offer insights for dealing with the common problem of irreducible uncertainty and suggestions for reframing management and policy direction; and identify key knowledge gaps and research needs.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  cThe Wilderness Society  cThe Nature Conservancy, Oregon  cConservation Northwest  cThe Ecological Restoration Institute  cWashington State Department of Natural Resources  cUSDA‐FS, the Pacific Northwest and Pacific Southwest Research Stations  cCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection 3aforest management 3aforests 3ainsects 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3alightning 3amortality 3aparalysis 3aprecautionary principle 3auncertainty 3awildfires 3aNorth America1 aPrichard, Susan J.eauthoruCollege of the Environment‐SEFS, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, 98195, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6001-14871 aHagmann, R.

Unprecedented red oak borer (ROB, Enaphalodes rufulus) outbreaks in 1999–2003 are associated with the largest oak mortality event reported in the Central Hardwood Region since the arrival of Europeans. Predicting and evaluating the effects of ROB disturbance on forest composition has practical value for forest management plans that aims to minimize ecological and economic loss from ROB disturbances. However, such prediction at a regional scale is rare due to the limited approaches that could explicitly couple insect outbreak mechanisms with forest dynamics under changing climate. We used a newly developed climate-sensitive Biotic Disturbance Agent module in the LANDIS PRO framework to simulate species composition changes due to succession, climate change, and ROB disturbances in 13.5 million ha forests in the U.S. Central Hardwood Region from 2000 to 2300. Our simulation suggested that succession is more important than climate effects and ROB disturbance in predicting regional species composition changes. ROB disturbance interacting with climate change accelerated the decline of primary host species (e.g., Quercus rubra) and then substantially changed forest succession trajectories under warming climates. Our modeling approach improved the simulation realism of ROB disturbance and more realistically projected how tree species will respond to ROB disturbance under changing climate, informing decision-making in silvicultural prescriptions and long-term management plans.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aGrant 14-JV-11330134-049cUS Department of Agriculture 3aEnaphalodes rufulus 3aQuercus rubra 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3afinancial economics 3aforest dynamics 3aforest management 3aforest succession 3ahardwood 3ahosts 3ainsect outbreaks 3ainsects 3amortality 3aprediction 3aresearch 3aspecies diversity 3atrees1 aHe, Hong S.eauthoruSchool of Natural Resources, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA. heh@missouri.edu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2771-66181 aSpetich, Martin A.eauthoruSouthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Hot Springs, AR, USA1 aWang, Wen J.eauthoruNortheast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Jilin, China1 aFraser, Jacob S.eauthoruNorthern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Columbia, MO, USA1 aXu, WenrueauthoruSchool of Natural Resources, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2022 Feb., v. 141, no. 1 p.153-164dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870054x1612-46697nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl387005440uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-021-01428-23Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3870054b1612-4669c141d1e153  fEuropean journal of forest research  aBatch:10239  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6076764769ExL  a2022-04-19  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_22-02-18_05-27-11.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10342-141-1.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7676476  a2022-02-20  a2022-04-1907209nab a2201009 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100016000179245007400339300001100413500001100424520305300435592002803488593001803516650002303534650001403557650002203571650001603593650001203609650001203621650001903633650001903652650002103671650000903692650001103701650001403712650001203726650001203738650001103750650002103761650001803782650002103800650001403821650002303835650002603858650001403884650002103898650001003919650001103929650001703940650001303957650002003970650001703990650002804007650001604035650001204051650002004063650001804083650001704101650001704118650001004135650001004145700014004155700013904295700018004434700013704614700014204751700010804893700010105001700013605102700013505238700013705373773012605510787003305636787001805669787002205687856008205709912001205791914004305803914004105846916001505887917001105902918002905913935002205942949001505964953006705979954005606046955003706102961001306139974001706152983001506169984001506184991588066710742620221119083425.0180619e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048815642DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-016-0350-52doi  aagid:4881564-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorres, NicholasE.eauthoruDepartment of Crop, Soil, and Environmental Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, 72704, USA. nkorres@yahoo.co.uk10aCultivars to face climate change effects on crops and weeds: a review  ap. 12.  aReview  aClimate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Climate change will impact many activities, but its effects on agricultural production could be acute. Estimates of annual damages in agriculture due to temperature increase or extended periods of drought will be more costly than damages in other activities. Yield losses are caused both by direct effects of climate change on crops and by indirect effects such as increased inputs in crop production for weed control. One possible solution to counteract the effects of climate change is to seek crop cultivars that are adapted to highly variable, extreme climatic conditions and pest changes. Here we review the effects of climate change on crop cultivars and weeds. Biomass increase will augment marketable yield by 8–70 % for C3 cereals, by 20–144 % for cash and vegetable crops, and by 6–35 % for flowers. Such positive effects could however be reduced by decreasing water and nutrient availability. Rising temperature will decrease yields of temperature-sensitive crops such as maize, soybean, wheat, and cotton or specialty crops such as almonds, grapes, berries, citrus, or stone fruits. Rice, which is expected to yield better under increased CO₂, will suffer serious yield losses under high temperatures. Drought stress should decrease the production of tomato, soybean, maize, and cotton. Nevertheless, reviews on C4 photosynthesis response to water stress in interaction with CO₂ concentration reveal that elevated CO₂ concentration lessens the deleterious effect of drought on plant productivity. C3 weeds respond more strongly than C4 types to CO₂ increases through biomass and leaf area increases. The positive response of C3 crops to elevated CO₂ may make C4 weeds less competitive for C3 crops, whereas C3 weeds in C4 or C3 crops could become a problem, particularly in tropical regions. Temperature increases will mainly affect the distribution of weeds, particularly C4 type, by expanding their geographical range. This will enhance further yield losses and will affect weed management systems negatively. In addition, the expansion of invasive weed species such as itchgrass, cogongrass, and witchweed facilitated by temperature increases will increase the cost for their control. Under water or nutrient shortage scenarios, an r-strategist with characteristics in the order S-C-R, such as Palmer amaranth, large crabgrass, johnsongrass, and spurges, will most probably prevail. Selection of cultivars that secure high yields under climate change but also by competing weeds is of major importance. Traits related with (a) increased root/shoot ratio, (b) vernalization periods, (c) maturity, (d) regulation of node formation and/or internode distance, (e) harvest index variations, and (f) allelopathy merit further investigation. The cumulative effects of selecting a suitable stress tolerator-competitor cultivar will be reflected in reductions of environmental pollution, lower production costs, and sustainable food production.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aAmaranthus palmeri 3aC3 plants 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aallelopathy 3aalmonds 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acorn 3acotton 3acultivars 3adrought 3aflowers 3agrapes 3agreenhouse gases 3aharvest index 3ainvasive species 3aleaf area 3amanagement systems 3anutrient availability 3apollution 3aproduction costs 3aroots 3ashoots 3asmall fruits 3asoybeans 3aspecialty crops 3astone fruits 3asustainable agriculture 3atemperature 3atropics 3avegetable crops 3avernalization 3awater stress 3aweed control 3aweeds 3awheat1 aNorsworthy, JasonK.eauthoruDepartment of Crop, Soil, and Environmental Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, 72704, USA1 aTehranchian, ParsaeauthoruDepartment of Crop, Soil, and Environmental Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, 72704, USA1 aGitsopoulos, ThomasK.eauthoruHellenic Agricultural Organization-Demeter, Institute of Plant Breeding and Phytogenetic Resources, P.O.

research networks explore the interaction of vertebrates, their characteristic arrays of pathogens and emergent disease. A diversity of programmes address the impact of environmental change on animal health, zoonoses, and human health, but as yet no comprehensive framework or strategy has emerged to develop and implement policy and planning. In a regime of climate change and ecological perturbation, the need to document and understand the health, agricultural, societal and economic impact of pathogens and emerging infectious disease is urgent. An integrated and proactive planning process linking national and international resources can lead to informed predictions aboutthe impact of environmental change and can identify pathways for potential management and mitigation. An effective and comprehensive programme will have components for establishing priorities, developing primary data for faunal structure and biodiversity, a capacity for monitoring and surveillance (including scanning and targeted activities), and linkage to historical and contemporary baselines (against which to assess change) established through archival biological collections. Field and laboratory studies are also necessary to determine developmental thresholds, tolerances and tipping points for many pathogens to establish a context for recognising current constraints and future perturbation, and to explore factors that promote emergence for a variety of pathogens, vectors and pest species. Predictive modelling and risk assessment utilising a range of scenarios for climate change is a final step in this multidisciplinary process.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aungulates 3aparasites 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3asurveys 3alivestock 3aclimate change 3aanimal pathogens 3awild animals 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aAnimals, Wild 2aArtiodactyla 2aBiodiversity 2aCommunicable Disease Controlxmethods 2aCommunicable Diseases, Emergingxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aForecasting 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aHost-Pathogen Interactionsxphysiology 2aPerissodactyla 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aRisk Assessment 2aSentinel Surveillancexveterinary 3aNorth America 0aresearch methods1 aPolley, L.1 aJenkins, E.J.1 aKutz, S.J.0 tRevue scientifique et technique.g2008 Aug., v.  27, no.  2 p.511-528x0253-19337nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/447103Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  fRevue scientifique et technique  aissued  a20101028b20101108c00000000  aIND443986799ExL  aINDdGAYe2010/10/20  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20101028 20101108 00000000bIND GAY 2010/10/20  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:44710  a2010-11-08  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a439867903991nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097024002100132035002600153040001800179072000900197072000900206072000900215100002000224245009300244300001600337500002400353520171700377593001802094593002002112650002502132650001902157650002002176650001002196650001602206650001802222650002102240650003102261650002402292650002202316650001902338651002402357700002202381700002802403700001902431700002202450773009902472787001802571787003302589787003002622787002102652852000902673856011202682856008502794912001202879914004502891914002002936917001102956930003302967935002103000945002503021946001103046949001503057952005103072961001303123974001503136984001503151985010303166986001203269991588767350742620221116161119.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442934552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-009-9615-12doi7 a10113/447572hdl  aagid:44757-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aL100 0aL6001 aMader, Terry L.10aPotential climate change effects on warm-season livestock production in the Great Plains  ap. 529-541.  aIncludes references  aProjected production responses were derived for confined swine and beef and for milk-producing dairy cattle based on climate change projections in daily ambient temperature. Milk production from dairy cattle and the number of days to grow swine and beef cattle were simulated. Values were obtained for three central United States transects and three climate scenarios which were based on projected mean daily ambient temperatures associated with a baseline, doubling, and tripling of atmospheric greenhouse gas (CO₂) levels for the period June 1 to October 31. For swine, a slight northwest to southeast gradient is evident. Transect 1 (west side) shows no losses under the doubling scenario and losses up to 22.4% under the tripling scenario. Transect 3 (east side) displays losses of over 70% under the tripling scenario. For beef, positive benefits were simulated in Transect 1 with increasing temperatures, although a northwest to southeast gradient was also evident. For dairy, no positive benefits in milk production were found due to climate effects. Projected production declines ranged from 1% to 7.2%, depending on location. However, ranges in predicted differences were less than those simulated for beef and swine. These simulations suggest regional differences in animal production due to climate change will be apparent. For small changes in climate conditions, animals will likely be able to adapt, while larger changes in climate conditions will likely dictate that management strategies be implemented. Exploration of the effects of climate changes on livestock should allow producers to adjust management strategies to reduce potential impact and economic losses due to environmental changes.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3alivestock production 3aclimate change 3amilk production 3aswine 3abeef cattle 3aanimal growth 3agreenhouse gases 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aambient temperature 3asimulation models 3acarbon dioxide 3aGreat Plains region1 aFrank, Katrina L.1 aHarrington, John A.

Scenarios for climate change vary latitudinally and regionally and involve direct and indirect linkages for increasing temperature and the dissemination, amplification, and invasiveness of vector-borne parasites. High latitude regions are especially influenced by global climate change and thus may be prone to altered associations and dynamics for complex host-pathogen assemblages and emergence of disease with cascading effects on ecosystem structure. Although the potential for substantial ecological perturbation has been identified, few empirical observations have emanated from systems across the Holarctic. Coincidental with decades of warming, and anomalies of high temperature and humidity in the sub-Arctic region of Fennoscandia, the mosquito-borne filarioid nematode Setaria tundra is now associated with emerging epidemic disease resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality for reindeer and moose. We describe a host-parasite system that involves reindeer, arthropods, and nematodes, which may contribute as a factor to ongoing declines documented for this ungulate species across northern ecosystems. We demonstrate that mean summer temperatures exceeding 14°C drive the emergence of disease due to S. tundra. An association between climate and emergence of filarioid parasites is a challenge to ecosystem services with direct effects on public health, sustainability of free-ranging and domestic ungulates, and ultimately food security for subsistence cultures at high latitudes.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRangifer tarandus 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aair temperature 3adisease outbreaks 3areindeer 3aanimal parasitic nematodes 3aglobal warming 3asummer 3amosquito-borne diseases 3aSetaria (Nematoda) 2aAnimals 2aClimate Change 2aCommunicable Diseases, Emergingxparasitologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aDisease Vectors 2aEcosystem 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxphysiology 2aNematodaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aNematode Infectionsxparasitologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aReindeer 2aTemperature 3aFinland 0aArctic regions. 0aSetaria tundra 0avector-borne diseases1 aPusenius, Jyrki1 aKumpula, Jouko1 aVenalainen, Ari1 aKortet, Raine1 aOksanen, Antti1 aHoberg, Eric0 tEcoHealth.g2010 Aug., v.  7, no.  1 p.7-13x1612-92107nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl4378570  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/447663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-010-0308-z3Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4378570b1612-9210c7d1e7  fEcoHealth  aissued  a20101028b20101108c00000000  aIND444169359ExL  aINDdGAYe2010/10/28  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20101028 20101108 00000000bIND GAY 2010/10/28  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:44766  a2010-11-08  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a441693504935nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003800121024004100159035002800200040001800228100010500246245011700351300001500468506007600483506003100559520164500590592002802235593001802263596008702281506003702368650002502405650001902430650002302449650002202472650002102494650000902515650002202524650001402546650003302560653002302593653001802616653001402634653001502648653001302663653001302676653001502689653001802704700017002722700013602892700010703028700012503135773012503260787003303385787001803418787002203436856008503458856011403543912001203657914004003669914003203709916001503741917001103756918003603767935002203803949001503825953007003840954007103910955004503981961001604026962004704042962001704089974001704106983001504123984001504138991589426060742620221215142607.0190411e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054375832DNAL7 a10113/54375832hdl7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2015.09.0012doi7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2015.09.0012chorus  aagid:5437583-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalton, Z.

To characterize the role of forest resources in reducing community vulnerability to the heat effects of climate change, a general index of heat vulnerability (HEVI) was developed through Principle Components Analysis (PCA) and subsequently used within ANVOA and Poisson regression to assess the relationship between the amount and type of forest resources (species, management regime, spatial pattern) and a county's vulnerability to the heat effects of climate change. Results of the ANOVA showed significant differences in the extent and characteristics of forests among counties experiencing different levels of heat vulnerability. The Poisson regression using county heat mortality as the dependent variable found forest characteristics to have a significant influence on heat mortality when other determinants of vulnerability were controlled. A negative and significant relationship was specifically found between forest area and heat related mortality, which supports the hypothesis that the extent of forest coverage helps to alleviate vulnerability associated with heat effects. These findings have important implications for understanding the role of forest ecosystem services in reducing a community's vulnerability to the heat effects of climate change. Findings will also be useful in guiding land use planning and preserving desirable forest characteristics to help communities adapt to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Stationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000069590 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest resources 3aheat 3aland use planning 3amortality 3aprincipal component analysis 0aEcosystem services 0aPublic health 0aMortality 0aAdaptation 0aCounties 0aLand use 0aHeat index 0aPoisson model1 aPoudyal, N.

A Critical Step in Tackling Climate Change  ap. 53-58.  aNAL-light  aJust Transition has become an established discursive and conceptual framework to transition economic industries toward a low-carbon and climate-resilient future. In the coal and mining industry in particular, it has gained a foothold and transformed politics and livelihoods. In other areas, like animal agriculture, which is equally damaging to the climate, the need for change and the deployment of Just Transition to achieve it are not yet established. Drawing on the most recent scientific insights by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), this viewpoint argues that transitioning toward a low-carbon production is just as imperative in agriculture. Specifically, it demands that we move away from animal agriculture. The viewpoint concludes by sketching possible areas and means of intervention.  aPubAg article  dKeyed article  a693balice.allenc2021-01-21damanda.xue2021-01-22 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aagriculture 3aanimals 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoal 3acommunity development 3alivelihood 3amining 3apolitics0 tJournal of agriculture, food systems, and community development.g2020, v. 9, no. 3 p.53-58dNew Leaf Associates, Inc.wJournal:6226x2152-08017nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)622640uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2020.093.006  aArticle  aJournal:6226  fJournal of agriculture, food systems, and community development  aBatch:2649  aissued  aIND6072357419ExL  a2021-03-18  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 2152-0801  aagid:7235741  a2021-01-15  a2021-03-1803122nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024005400097024002100151035002600172040001800198072000900216072000900225072000900234100001700243245008700260300001400347500002400361500001500385520091600400593001801316593002001334650002201354650002501376650001501401650002001416650001201436650001901448650001501467650001301482650001501495651001301510651001001523651000901533653001801542700001701560700002001577700001801597773006801615787001801683787003301701787003001734787001801764852000901782856011201791856010401903912001202007914003902019914001502058917001102073930003302084935002102117945002502138946001302163949001502176952005102191961001302242974001502255984001502270985010302285986001202388991589563380742620221116155620.0090629e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442256232DNAL7 a10.2111/1551-501X(2008)30[46:CCAEOA]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/305182hdl  aagid:30518-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aF130 0aF3001 aAngerer, Jay10aClimate Change and Ecosystems of Asia With Emphasis on Inner Mongolia and Mongolia  ap. 46-51.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  a
Being the most populated continent on the planet, Asia offers enormous lands for livestock, where more than half of its people live in rural areas and use the rangelands for their livelihood. For many Asian countries, rangelands represent a major land category. One country that heavily relies on rangelands is Mongolia. In Inner Mongolia and Mongolia, livestock production on rangelands is a major source of wealth and well being. However, projections relating to climate change show that Mongolia and Inner Mongolia rangelands will experience increased annual temperatures from 2.5-5.0 degrees Celsius, with increases occurring during both the winter and summer months. In the winter months across the region, precipitation will increase, and there will be a slight decrease in precipitation across the western desert steppe and a slight increase in annual precipitation across the meadow steppe to the east.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3asimulation models 3aenvironmental impact 3arangelands 3aair temperature 3adrought 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aland use 3aprediction 3aMongolia 3aChina 0aAsia 0aprecipitation1 aHan, Guodong1 aFujisaki, Ikuko1 aHavstad, Kris0 tRangelands.g2008 June, v.  30, no.  3 p.46-51x1551-501X7nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)3143  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/305183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111/1551-501X(2008)30[46:CCAEOA]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:3143b1551-501Xc30d3e46  fRangelands  aissued  a20090701b20090703c00000000  aIND442256239ExL  aINDdGAYe2009/07/01  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20090701 20090703 00000000bIND GAY 2009/07/01  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:30518  a2009-07-04  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a422562305047nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100018800180245008100368300001100449520185900460592002802319593001802347650001202365650001902377650002002396650001202416650001102428650002302439650001502462650001102477650002102488650001002509650001102519650001302530650000902543650001302552650001502565650001602580650001202596650002102608650001802629650001902647650001602666650002202682700011802704700009602822700013802918700011503056700015903171700009003330700007503420700010803495773011303603787003303716787001803749787002103767856008303788912001203871914004503883914002003928916001603948917001103964918002903975935002204004949001504026953006704041954005904108955003704167961001404204974001704218983001504235984001504250991589675470742620221116164751.0220628e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073252952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-021-03057-52doi  aagid:7325295-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeters-Lidard, Christa D.eauthoruEarth Sciences Division, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, 20771, USA. christa.peters@nasa.gov1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1255-287610aIndicators of climate change impacts on the water cycle and water management  ap. 36.  aManaging water is a top social and economic responsibility and is expected to become even more critical as climate change, in addition to other human activities, alters water availability and quality. Robust indicators reflecting the effects of climate change on the US and global water cycles are needed in order to appropriately manage water resources. Here, we describe a suite of seventeen water cycle and management indicators, which are based on synthesis of available datasets. These indicators include average and heavy precipitation, standardized precipitation index, annual, 7-day low and 3-day high streamflow volume, streamflow timing, snow cover, snow water equivalent, groundwater level, lake water temperature, stream water temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, Palmer Drought Severity Index, water withdrawals, and water use. We also identify three indicators that could be included in the suite of water cycle and management indicators with some additional, directed work: snowfall, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture. Our conceptual framework focuses on known water cycle changes in addition to potential effects on management and addresses water quantity and quality, as well as water use and related interactions with freshwater ecosystems, societal impacts, and management. Water cycle indicators are organized into three categories: (1) hydrologic processes, (2) water quality processes, and (3) water quality and quantity impacts. Indicators described here are recommended to serve as critical references for periodic climate assessments. As such, these indicators support analyses of the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy, and water resources, among other sectors.

Many studies have been done regarding the effect on the mean of such distributions but few have addressed the effect on variance. Furthermore, those that have been done generally report the variance from crop simulators, not from observations. This paper examines the potential effects of climate change on crop yield variance in the context of current observed yields and then extrapolates to the effects under projected climate change. In particular, maximum likelihood panel data estimates of the impacts of climate on year-to-year yield variability are constructed for the major U.S. agricultural crops. The panel data technique used embodies a variance estimate developed along the lines of the stochastic production function approach suggested by Just and Pope. The estimation results indicate that changes in climate modify crop yield levels and variances in a crop-specific fashion. For sorghum, rainfall and temperature increases are found to increase yield level and variability. On the other hand, precipitation and temperature are individually found to have opposite effects on corn yield levels and variability.  aPubAg article 3aanalysis of variance 3agrain sorghum 3asoybeans 3acorn 3awheat 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3atemperature 3aUnited States 0amathematics and statistics 0aprecipitation1 aMcCarl, Bruce A.1 aSchimmelpfennig, David E.0 tClimatic change.g2004 Sept., v.  66, no.  1-2 p.239-2617nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 oislandora_article_repository  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/386023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:CLIM.0000043159.33816.e53Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  fClimatic change  aissued  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aIND443281569ExL  aINDdGAYe2010/02/19  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20100220 20100305 00000000bIND GAY 2010/02/19  aUSDA/ERS  aagid:38602  a2010-03-06  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a432815604899nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002500098035002800123040001800151100014800169245015200317300001300469520131200482592002801794593001801822650001801840650001201858650001901870650002401889650001101913650001001924650001501934650001401949651002601963653001301989653001302002653001702015653001802032653002502050653003402075653002502109700009302134700026502227700012202492700012002614700016302734700011002897700010103007700011703108700009203225700010603317773012403423787003303547787001803580787002203598856007203620912001203692914004203704914004303746916001603789917001103805918008903816935002203905949001503927952001903942953004603961954005304007955003404060961001204094974001704106983001504123984001504138991589695380742620221116172003.0220126s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076424872DNAL7 a10.1071/WF201902doi  aagid:7642487-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, YongqianguCenter for Forest Disturbance Science, USDA Forest Service, 320 Green Street, Athens, GA 30602, USA; and Corresponding author. 10aProjection of future wildfire emissions in western USA under climate change: contributions from changes in wildfire, fuel loading and fuel moisture  ap. 1-13.  aNumerous devastating air pollution events from wildfire smoke occurred in this century in the western USA, leading to severe environmental consequences. This study projects future fire emissions in this region under climate change with a focus on comparing the relative contributions from future changes in burned area, fuel loading and fuel moisture. The three properties were projected using an empirical fire model, a dynamical global vegetation model and meteorological conditions respectively. The regional climate change scenarios for the western USA were obtained by dynamical downscaling of global climate projections. The results show overall increasing wildfires and fuel loading and decreasing fuel moisture. As a result, fire emissions are projected to increase by ~50% from 2001&#x2013;2010 to 2050&#x2013;2059. The changes in wildfires and fuel loading contribute nearly 75% and 25% of the total fire emission increase, respectively, but the contribution from fuel moisture change is minimal. The findings suggest that the air pollution events caused by wildfire smoke could become much more serious in the western USA by the middle of this century, and that it would be essential to take the future changes in fuel conditions into account to improve the accuracy of fire emission projections.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aair pollution 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afuel moisture index 3amodels 3asmoke 3avegetation 3awildfires 3aWestern United States 0awildfire 0aemission 0afuel loading 0afuel moisture 0avegetation modelling 0adynamical climate downscaling 0afire potential index1 aLiu, YanguDepartment of Environmental Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.1 aFu, JoshuauDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, USA; and Climate Change Science Institute and Computational Sciences and Engineering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831, USA.1 aYang, Cheng-EnuDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, USA.1 aDong, XingyiuDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, USA.1 aTian, HanqinuInternational Center for Climate and Global Change Research, School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.1 aTao, BouCollege of Agriculture, Food, and Environment, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40546, USA.1 aYang, JiauCollege of Forest Resources, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS 39762, USA.1 aWang, YuhanguSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.1 aZou, YufeiuPacific Northwest National Laboratory, PO Box 999, Richland, WA 99352, USA.1 aKe, ZiminguDepartment of Atmospheric Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA.0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2021, v. 31, no. 1 p.1-13dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl57534x1049-80017nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5753440uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF201903Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57534b1049-8001c31d1e1  fInternational journal of wildland fire  aBatch:10228  aissued2 aCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)eprovider5DNAL  aIND6076424879ExL  a2022-02-23  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/csiro/WF_31_1.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/csiro/WF20190abs.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/csiro/  aUSDA/FS  aagid:7642487  a2022-01-26  a2022-02-2104585nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004200097024002100139035002600160040001800186072000900204072000900213072000900222072000900231100002000240245013000260300001600390500002400406500001500430520206100445593001802506593002002524650002302544650002802567650002302595650001102618650001902629650002202648650001902670650001202689651001902701653001302720653003202733653002402765653002202789653002502811653003202836653003402868653001502902653001602917700002102933700002002954773010702974787001803081787003303099787003003132787002203162852000903184856011203193856009203305912001203397914004403409914002603453917001103479930003303490935002103523945002503544946001103569949001503580952005103595961001203646974001503658984001503673985010303688986001203791991589931610742620221116194729.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443231032DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01965.x2doi7 a10113/403262hdl  aagid:40326-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aP050 0aL300 0aK0011 aCARROLL, CARLOS10aOptimizing resiliency of reserve networks to climate change: multispecies conservation planning in the Pacific Northwest, USA  ap. 891-904.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe effectiveness of a system of reserves may be compromised under climate change as species' habitat shifts to nonreserved areas, a problem that may be compounded when well-studied vertebrate species are used as conservation umbrellas for other taxa. The Northwest Forest Plan was among the first efforts to integrate conservation of wide-ranging focal species and localized endemics into regional conservation planning. We evaluated how effectively the plan's focal species, the Northern Spotted Owl, acts as an umbrella for localized species under current and projected future climates and how the regional system of reserves can be made more resilient to climate change. We used the program maxent to develop distribution models integrating climate data with vegetation variables for the owl and 130 localized species. We used the program zonation to identify a system of areas that efficiently captures habitat for both the owl and localized species and prioritizes refugial areas of climatic and topographic heterogeneity where current and future habitat for dispersal-limited species is in proximity. We projected future species' distributions based on an ensemble of contrasting climate models, and incorporating uncertainty between alternate climate projections into the prioritization process. Reserve solutions based on the owl overlap areas of high localized-species richness but poorly capture core areas of localized species' distribution. Congruence between priority areas across taxa increases when refugial areas are prioritized. Although core-area selection strategies can potentially increase the conservation value and resilience of regional reserve systems, they accentuate contrasts in priority areas between species and over time and should be combined with a broadened taxonomic scope and increased attention to potential effects of climate change. Our results suggest that systems of fixed reserves designed for resilience can increase the likelihood of retaining the biological diversity of forest ecosystems under climate change.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aendangered species 3apopulation distribution 3aStrix occidentalis 3amodels 3aclimate change 3awildlife habitats 3abioclimatology 3aforests 3aPacific States 0azonation 0aStrix occidentalis caurina, 0awildlife management 0abioclimatic niche 0aspatial optimization 0aconservation prioritization 0aspecies distribution modeling 0avegetation 0aspotted owl1 aDunk, Jeffrey R.1 aMoilanen, Atte.0 tGlobal change biology.g2010 Mar., v.  16, no.  3 p.891-904dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl57021  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/403263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01965.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c16d3e891  fGlobal change biology  aissued  a20100409b20100501c00000000  aIND443231039ExL  aINDdGAYe2010/04/09  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20100409 20100501 00000000bIND GAY 2010/04/09  aUSDA/FS  aagid:40326  a2010-05-01  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a432310304541nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004400098024004100142035002800183040001800211100009900229245008200328500001900410506007600429506003100505520192600536592002802462593001802490596004502508506003702553650001202590650001202602650001302614650001202627650001902639650001602658650001602674650001102690650001602701650002002717650001002737650001502747650001302762650001002775650001602785651001502801653001602816653001202832700014302844700009902987773013403086787003303220787001803253787002103271856008803292912001203380914003903392914003703431916001603468917001103484918003603495935002203531949001503553953009103568954006103659955003503720961001703755974001703772983001503789984001503804991589965300742620221207085322.0210305e20210325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071936052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1439712chorus7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1439712doi  aagid:7193605-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, LaureneauthoruUSDA California Climate Hub, Davis, CA 95616, United States of America10aClimate change reduces frost exposure for high-value California orchard crops  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFrost exposure is a particular challenge for cultivating perennial crops, whose adaptive capacity to weather and climate impacts is limited. Irrigation is a common means of mitigating damage, but draws on limited water resources, is costly, and energy intensive. Here we examined the projected impact of climate change on the incidence of frost temperatures during the coldest winters, defined by the 98th percentile of cool season (November–April) frost hours, under both early- and mid-21st century time periods, as compared to contemporary conditions, across a range of threshold temperatures. We focused on three high-value perennial orchard crops – almonds, avocados, and oranges – to assess the effects of climate change on the incidence of temperatures below crop-specific threshold temperatures and for crop-specific critical development phases, and what these temporal changes in frost exposure may mean for the water and energy requirements for mitigating damages. Across time periods and temperature thresholds, frost exposure declines in California's agricultural regions, with an average of reduction in frost exposure of 63% by the mid-21st century. The majority of almond and orange acreage saw 50–75% reductions in frost exposure by mid-century, while avocado acreage experienced >75% fewer frost hours. This yielded attendant reductions in water use and energy costs, and growers in the highest acreage counties may save more than 50,000 acre feet of water and $4.2 million in electricity costs for water pumping per year, collectively. Although climate change is projected to increase growing season crop water demands, pest pressures, and have an overall net-negative impact on agriculture, the potential reduction in frost exposure and the accompanying water and energy costs to mitigate frost damages may allow growers to reprioritize some of their long-term decisions around farm management.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacreage 3aalmonds 3aavocados 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acold season 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3afarm management 3afrost 3airrigation 3aorchards 3apests 3atemperature 3aCalifornia 0aAgriculture 0aOranges1 aPathak, TapaneauthoruDivision of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of California, Merced, CA 95343, United States of America1 aOstoja, SteveneauthoruUSDA California Climate Hub, Davis, CA 95616, United States of America0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 762 p.143971-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl445540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1439713Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4455b0048-9697e143971  fScience of the total environment  aBatch:10130  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6071936059ExL  a2021-09-14  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/976958156015992790-00002-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0048969720375021.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aagid:7193605  a2021-03-05  a2022-09-0604709nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100013000171245012100301500002000422520166800442592002802110593001802138596006702156596005302223596003302276596006902309596006902378650001802447650002102465650002202486650002102508650002002529650001302549650001202562650001202574650001602586650002102602650001202623650001902635650001302654650001502667650001102682650001402693650002202707650001602729650001002745650001402755651001102769700014702780700010602927700011103033700014303144773010703287787003303394787001803427787001903445856007303464912001203537914004503549914001403594916001503608917001103623918004303634935002203677949001503699953005803714954006203772955003403834961001203868974001703880983001503897984001503912991589996730742620221116202818.0191213e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067781362DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.29342doi  aagid:6778136-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCassell, Brooke A.eauthoruEnvironmental Science and Management Department, Portland State University, Portland, Oregon, USA10aWidespread severe wildfires under climate change lead to increased forest homogeneity in dry mixed‐conifer forests  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate warming in the western United States is causing changes to the wildfire regime in mixed‐conifer forests. Rising temperatures, longer fire seasons, increased drought, as well as fire suppression and changes in land use, have led to greater and more severe wildfire activity, all contributing to altered forest composition over the past century. To understand future interactions among climate, wildfire, and vegetation in a fire‐prone landscape in the southern Blue Mountains of central Oregon, we used a spatially explicit forest landscape model, LANDIS‐II, to simulate forest and fire dynamics under current management practices and two projected climate scenarios. The results suggest that wildfires will become more frequent, more extensive, and more severe under projected climate than contemporary climate. Furthermore, projected climate change generated a 20% increase in the number of extreme fire years (years with at least 40,000 ha burned). This caused large shifts in tree species composition, characterized by a decline in the sub‐alpine species (Abies lasiocarpa, Picea engelmannii, Pinus albicaulis) and increases in lower‐elevation species (Pinus ponderosa, Abies grandis), resulting in forest homogenization across the elevational gradient. This modeling study suggests that climate‐driven increases in fire activity and severity will make high‐elevation species vulnerable to decline and will reduce landscape heterogeneity. These results underscore the need for forest managers to actively consider climate change, altered fire regimes, and projected declines in sub‐alpine species in their long‐term management plans.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUS Department of Agriculture Forest Service National Fire Plan  aJFSP 14‐1‐01‐2cJoint Fire Science Program  cMicrosoft Azure for Research  cPortland State University's Ed and Olive Bushby Scholarship Fund  cU.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service National Fire Plan 3aAbies grandis 3aAbies lasiocarpa 3aPicea engelmannii 3aPinus albicaulis 3aPinus ponderosa 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3adrought 3afire regime 3afire suppression 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amountains 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3atrees 3awildfires 3aOregon1 aScheller, Robert M.eauthoruDepartment of Forestry and Environmental Resources, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA1 aLucash, Melissa S.eauthoruDepartment of Geography, Portland State University, Portland, Oregon, USA1 aHurteau, Matthew D.eauthoruDepartment of Biology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA1 aLoudermilk, E.

Examining how Ta increases are influencing extreme temperatures at the soil surface and belowground in the soil profile can refine our understanding of the ecological consequences of rising temperatures. In this paper, we validate surface and soil temperature (Ts: 0–100-cm depth) simulations in the SOILWAT2 model for 29 locations comprising 5 ecosystem types in the central and western USA. We determine the temperature characteristics of these locations from 1980 to 2015, and explore simulations of Ta and Ts change over 2030–2065 and 2065–2100 time periods using General Circulation Model (GCM) projections and the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario. We define temperature extremes using a nonstationary peak over threshold method, quantified from standard deviations above the mean (0-σ: an event [Formula: see text] 51% of extreme events; 2-[Formula: see text]). Our primary objective is to contrast the magnitude (∘C) and frequency of occurrence of extreme temperature events between the twentieth and twenty-first century. We project that temperatures will increase substantially in the twenty-first century. Extreme Ta events will experience the largest increases by magnitude, and extreme Ts events will experience the largest increases by proportion. On average, 2-σ extreme Ts events will increase by 3.4 ∘C in 2030–2065 and by 5.3 ∘C in 2065–2100. Increases in extreme Ts events will often exceed + 10 ∘C at 0–20 cm by 2065–2100, and at 0–100 cm will often exceed 5.0 standard deviations above 1980–2015 values. 2-σ extreme Ts events will increase from 0.9 events per decade in 1980–2015 to 23 events in 2030–2065 and 38 events in 2065–2100. By 2065–2100, the majority of months will experience extreme events that co-occur at 0–100 cm, which did not occur in 1980–2015. These projections illustrate the non-analog temperature increases that ecosystems will experience in the twenty-first century as a result of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aair 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3adepth 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3afrequency 3aoccurrence 3apaper 3asoil profiles 3asoil temperature 3astandard deviation 3aWestern United States1 aBradford, J.

Agricultural is a complex system within the USA encompassing a large number of crops and livestock systems, and development of indicators to provide a signal of the impact of climate change on these different systems would be beneficial to the development of strategies for effective adaptation practices. A series of indicators were assembled to determine their potential for assessing agricultural response to climate change in the near term and long term and those with immediate capability of being implemented and those requiring more development. The available literature reveals indicators on livestock related to heat stress, soil erosion related to changes in precipitation, soil carbon changes in response to increasing carbon dioxide and soil management practices, economic response to climate change in agricultural production, and crop progress and productivity. Crop progress and productivity changes are readily observed data with a historical record for some crops extending back to the mid-1800s. This length of historical record coupled with the county-level observations from each state where a crop is grown and emerging pest populations provides a detailed set of observations to assess the impact of a changing climate on agriculture. Continued refinement of tools to assess climate impacts on agriculture will provide guidance on strategies to adapt to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aagriculture

watershed-scale assessment of climate change impacts, but post-processing of model outputs is a tedious job. An R tool was developed in this study for batch processing of SWAT output results. A case study was then performed in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the Texas Panhandle using an improved SWAT model with the R tool to evaluate the simulated future changes in water balance components, total nitrogen (TN) load, and crop growth over the watershed. The results showed that the average annual future surface runoff increased by 8.9–17.9 mm and 11.5–22.6 mm in the irrigated and dryland cotton areas, respectively. Similarly, future TN load in irrigated and dryland cotton areas increased by approximately 0.4–0.9 kg ha⁻¹ and 1.9–2.4 kg ha⁻¹. The yields of irrigated and dryland cotton increased by 91.1%–122.1% and 47.5%–84.0% under the future climate scenarios, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aarid lands 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3acotton 3airrigation 3arunoff 3atotal nitrogen 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aTexas 0aSWAT-MAD 0aCMIP6 0aHydrologic cycle 0aTotal nitrogen load 0aCotton 0aSemi-arid region1 aLiu, HaipengeauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China1 aLi, YingxuaneauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China1 aZhang, XueliangeauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China1 aFeng, PuyueauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China1 aLiu, De LieauthoruNSW Department of Primary Industries, Wagga Wagga Agricultural Institute, Wagga Wagga, NSW, 2650, Australia1 aMarek, Gary W.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, TX, 79012, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8682-25391 aAle, SrinivasulueauthoruTexas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center at Vernon, Vernon, TX, 76384, USA1 aBrauer, David K.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, TX, 79012, USA1 aSrinivasan, RaghavaneauthoruDepartment of Ecosystem Science and Management, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA1 aChen, YongeauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2022 Oct., v. 156 p.105492-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1163440uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.1054923Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/78893423Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:11634b1364-8152e105492  fEnvironmental modelling & software  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6078893429ExL  a2022-09-01  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/146981299745904067-00004-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.ZIP  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S1364815222001955.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aARIS manuscript submission  aARIS Manuscript  aagid:7889342  a2022-09-06  a2022-09-0605505nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003700097035002700134040001800161100013800179245010000317300001500417520264600432592002803078593001803106650003403124650001303158650003003171650001903201650001903220650000903239650001503248650001403263650002303277650002103300650002103321650001603342650002503358651001303383651002403396700014603420700013903566700013603705700024703841700010404088773009504192787003304287787001804320787002104338856008304359912001204442914004004454914003404494917001104528918003404539935002104573949001504594953003304609961001304642962004804655962004704703962004704750974001604797983001504813984001504828991590481600742620221116165644.0150812e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447565082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2012.04.0042doi  aagid:568744-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, AdluleauthoruUSDA-ARS Agricultural Systems Research Unit, 2150 Centre Avenue, Bldg D., Fort Collins, CO 80526, United States10aModeling the impacts of climate change on irrigated corn production in the Central Great Plains  ap. 94-108.  aThe changes in temperature and precipitation patterns along with increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) may change evapotranspiration (ET) demand, and affect water availability and crop production. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change and elevated CO₂ on irrigated corn (Zea mays L.) in the Central Great Plains of Colorado was conducted using the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) model. One hundred and twelve bias corrected and spatially disaggregated (BCSD) climate projections were used to generate four different multi-model ensemble scenarios of climate change: three of the ensembles represented the A1B, A2, and B1 emission scenarios and the fourth comprised of all 112 BCSD projections. Three different levels of irrigation, based on meeting 100, 75, and 50% of the crop ET demand, were used to study the climate change effects on corn yield and water use efficiency (WUE) under full and deficit irrigation. Predicted increases in mean monthly temperature during the crop growing period varied from 1.4 to 1.9, 2.1 to 3.4, and 2.7 to 5.4°C during the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, for the different climate change scenarios. During the same periods, the projected changes in mean monthly precipitation varied in the range of −4.5 to 1.7, −6.6 to 4.0 and −11.5 to 10.2%, respectively. Simulation results showed a decrease in corn yield, because the negative effects of increase in temperature dominated over the positive effects of increasing CO₂ levels. The mean overall decrease in yield for the four different climate change scenarios, with full irrigation, ranged from 11.3 to 14.0, 17.1 to 21.0, and 20.7 to 27.7% during the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, even though the CO₂ alone increased yield by 3.5 to 12.8% for the scenario representing ensembles of 112 projections (S1). The yield decrease was linearly related to the shortening of the growing period caused by increased temperature. Under deficit irrigation, the yield decreases were smaller due to increased WUE with elevated CO₂. Because of the shortened crop growing period and the CO₂ effect of decreasing the ET demand, there was a decrease in the required irrigation. Longer duration cultivars tolerant to higher temperatures may be one of the possible adaptation strategies. The amount of irrigation water needed to maintain the current yield for a longer duration corn cultivar, having the same WUE as the current cultivar, is projected to change in the range of −1.7 to 6.4% from the current baseline, under the four different scenarios of climate change evaluated in this research.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aRoot Zone Water Quality Model 3aZea mays 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3adeficit irrigation 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3atemperature 3awater use efficiency 3aColorado 3aGreat Plains region1 aAhuja, L.q(Lajpat),eauthoruUSDA-ARS Agricultural Systems Research Unit, 2150 Centre Avenue, Bldg D., Fort Collins, CO 80526, United States1 aGarcia, Luis A.eauthoruDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States1 aMa, LiwangeauthoruUSDA-ARS Agricultural Systems Research Unit, 2150 Centre Avenue, Bldg D., Fort Collins, CO 80526, United States1 aSaseendran, Anapalli S.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Agricultural Systems Research Unit, 2150 Centre Avenue, Bldg D., Fort Collins, CO 80526, United States; Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States1 aTrout, Thomas J.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Water Management Research Unit, Fort Collins, CO, United States0 tAgricultural water management.g2012 July, v. 110 p.94-108dElsevier B.V.x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2012.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774c110e94  fAgricultural water management  aissued2 aElsevier B.V.eprovider5DNAL  aIND447565089ExL  a2014-01-16  aNAL26530037837740110000C.xml  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:405 annotated on 2013-12-13T17:41:24Z  aBatch:405 reviewed on 2014-01-15T16:00:03Z  aBatch:405 reviewed on 2014-01-16T04:00:03Z  aagid:568744  a2015-08-12  a2015-08-1203261nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024002700121024003000148035002800178040001800206100017800224245006400402300001800466520100800484592002801492593001801520596000901538650001901547650002301566650001501589650001301604650000901617650001301626650001601639650001601655651001101671651001001682651001101692651001001703651001801713700017801731773014501909787003302054787001802087787002402105856007302129912001202202914003602214914003302250917001102283918002702294935002202321949001502343952001902358955003402377961000902411962004702420974001702467983003002484984001502514985010602529991590971230742620221116143821.0220901e20130328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073080222DNAL7 a10113/73080222hdl7 a10.1002/grl.502792doi7 a10.1002/grl.502792chorus  aagid:7308022-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiao,eauthoruVen Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Urbana IL 61801 USA10aClimate change impacts on global agricultural water deficit  ap. 1111-1117.  aThis paper assesses the change in crop water deficits (the difference between crop evapotranspiration and precipitation that is effective for crop growth) of 26 crops (including rainfed and irrigated) under current (1961–1990) and projected climates (2070–2099). We found that despite the universally rising mean temperature, crop water deficits are likely to decline slightly at the global scale, although changes vary by region. While the increasing precipitation and changing intra‐annual precipitation distribution in many areas can lead to more effective rainfall for crop growth, the declining diurnal temperature range will play a key role in offsetting the warming effect at the global scale. Regionally, Africa and China are likely to benefit from lower water requirements, but the impacts on other regions, including Europe, India, South America, and the United States, are subject to the land‐use types (rainfed or irrigated) and the uncertainty involved in the assessment approaches.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3ageophysics 3aland use 3arain 3aresearch 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3aAfrica 3aChina 3aEurope 3aIndia 3aSouth America1 aCai , XimingeauthoruVen Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Urbana IL 61801 USA0 tGeophysical Research Letters.g2013 Mar. 28, v. 40, no. 6 p.1111-1117dAmerican Geophysical Union (AGU)wJournal:jnl4100348x0094-82767nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl410034840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/grl.502793Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4100348c40d6e1111  fGeophysical Research Letters  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073080229ExL  a2022-04-22  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1944-8007  aagid:7308022  a2022-09-01T12:42:18-04:00  a2022-09-09  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl02142nab a2200649 u 4500001001700000005001700017008003300034016002200067024002000089035002500109040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001700179245013200196500002400328500001500352593001800367594002200385650002000407650001500427650002300442650001500465650003300480650002000513650001900533650002100552650001700573650002600590651001500616653002100631700001400652700001800666700001900684700001900703773013600722787001800858787003300876852000900909856011100918912001201029914010401041917001101145930003301156935002101189945002501210946001101235949001501246952005101261961001301312974001401325979002301339984001501362985010301377986001201480991591135260742620221116154217.0080205|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND440105572DNAL7 a10113/99952hdl  aagid:9995-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aJ200 0aP2101 aBusscher, W.10aImprovement of soil physical and chemical conditions to promote sustainable crop production in agricultural areas of Kazakhstan  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article 3adesertification 3aarid zones 3aagricultural soils 3aarid lands 3adry environmental conditions 3asoil properties 3asemiarid zones 3aland restoration 3asoil erosion 3airrigation management 3aKazakhstan 0asoil degradation1 aNovak, J.1 aKozybaeva, F.1 aJalankuzov, T.1 aSuleymenov, B.0 tClimate change and terrestrial carbon sequestration in Central Asia /  editors, R.

Two parameters characterize TBS, minimum TBS (MTBS) and average TBS (ATBS)—both vary monthly and are calculated by assuming TBS follows an exponential distribution. Detecting changes in these parameters due to climate is important for precipitation and climate studies at short time and small spatial scales, but there are issues with depth resolution of precipitation data that must first be investigated. Precipitation data having one-minute temporal and 0.25 mm (0.01 in) depth resolutions from the UDSA Agricultural Research Service North Appalachian Experimental Watershed (NAEW) at Coshocton, Ohio, were used to determine the spatial variability and consistency of estimates over the 425 ha (1,050 ac) facility and the impacts of coarsening the depth resolution of data 10 times to 2.54 mm (0.1 in). The magnitudes and trends of changes in MTBS and ATBS are determined for three rain gauges over the NAEW and extended to other gauges in the Ohio region. Approximately 5,800 parameter pairs were computed for different data configurations. Small spatial scale, NAEW high-resolution precipitation data shows consistent MTBS and ATBS long-term values for each month but more variability in estimates for MTBS than ATBS. Climate change trends for MTBS and ATBS are not apparent and generally consistent for different NAEW gauges, except for November when all gauges were consistently significant for ATBS. There is a weak indication that the fall months may be affected by significant shortening of ATBS at the NAEW and in northeastern Ohio due to climate change, but more data are needed. An imposed, coarser NAEW data resolution results in consistent no-trend indications for MTBS, but not for ATBS. The coarse-resolution data may not be adequate to characterize TBS for investigating changes due to climate change unless more data preparation is performed, such as identifying and excluding dry times when precipitation may have occurred. Precipitation records with mixed resolution data cannot be used to detect climate changes of dry periods. More data and data preparation are needed to arrive at firm conclusions regarding climate change effects on TBS in Ohio.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  bjgilbertc2016-04-08dfedoraAdmine2016-04-08  eARIS manuscript 3aautumn 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahydrologic models 3arain 3arain gauges 3astorms 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 3aOhio0 tJournal of soil and water conservation.g2013 , v. 68, no. 3 p.238-253wJournal:1947x0022-45617nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)194740uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/620483Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.68.3.2383Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:1947b0022-4561c68d3e238  fJournal of soil and water conservation  aBatch:1325  aBatch:1329  aissued  aIND6000620489ExL  a2016-06-23  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Journal%20of%20Soil%20and%20Water%20Conservation-2013-Bonta-238-53.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:1329 reviewed on 2016-06-23T04:00:02Z  aagid:62048  a2016-03-03  a2016-06-23  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans929103056nab a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098035002800139040001800167100019000185245009700375520091400472592002801386593001801414650003001432650001101462650001201473650001901485650001101504650001101515650001101526651001001537653003401547653002201581653001101603653001001614700014901624773011901773787003301892787001801925787002101943856008801964912001202052914004402064914003702108916001502145917001102160918003602171935002202207949001502229953009102244954006102335955003502396961001202431974001702443983001502460984001502475991591431220742620221116184229.0200601e20200625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068784672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1380242doi  aagid:6878467-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorenzo, M.N.eauthoruEnvironmental Physics Laboratory (EphysLab), CIM-UVIGO, Universidade de Vigo, Edificio Campus da Auga, 32004 Ourense, Spain1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5302-831210aClimate change patterns in precipitation over Spain using CORDEX projections for 2021–2050  aThis work presents an analysis of the climate change scenarios in some extreme precipitation indices over Spain using simulations from the EURO-CORDEX project. Change projections of precipitation are evaluated for the near future (2021–2050) relatively to a reference past climate (1971–2000). Projections of annual precipitation show a general decrease in almost the whole region except over the central area where positive changes are detected due to a significant increase in winter. For consecutive wet days, an annual decrease is also projected over the country attributable to a significant decrease mainly observed in spring and to a lesser extent in winter. On the other hand, consecutive dry days are projected to be higher overall as a result of significant increases in spring, summer and autumn. Positive changes are also projected for the maximum daily precipitation during winter and autumn.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aautumn 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aSpain 0aExtreme precipitation indices 0aWarming scenarios 0aCORDEX 0aSpain1 aAlvarez, I.eauthoruEnvironmental Physics Laboratory (EphysLab), CIM-UVIGO, Universidade de Vigo, Edificio Campus da Auga, 32004 Ourense, Spain0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 25, v. 723 p.138024-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl445540uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1380243Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4455b0048-9697c723e138024  fScience of the total environment  aBatch:2470  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6068784679ExL  a2020-05-15  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/181312169130961219-00001-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S0048969720315370.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/DA  aagid:6878467  a2020-06-01  a2020-06-0104539nab a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003400121024003700155035002800192040001800220100013500238245008700373506007600460506003100536520201700567592002802584593001802612596004702630596002402677506003702701650001102738650002702749650001902776650001502795650002302810650001202833650001402845650002902859700010002888700008302988700010003071773008303171787003303254787001803287787001903305856011403324856008103438912001203519914003003531914004603561916001603607917001103623918002703634935002203661949001503683955003403698961000903732974001703741979003403758984001503792985010603807991591496930742620221207070306.0220901e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074058932DNAL7 a10113/74058932hdl7 a10.1177/14779714198406702doi7 a10.1177/14779714198406702chorus  aagid:7405893-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchattman, Rachel EeauthoruUSDA Northeast Climate Hub, Burlington, VT, USA, University of Vermont Extension, Burlington, VT, USA10aClimate change curricula for adult audiences in agriculture and forestry: A review  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAgricultural and forestry advisers and other technical service providers play an important role in supporting farmers and foresters to adapt to climate change. However, not all agricultural and forestry advisers are comfortable talking about climate change with land managers. While there is a demonstrated interest related to climate related professional development, few examples of curricula developed with the express purpose of serving this audience and a systematic review of these curricula has not been conducted. To address this gap, we reviewed 12 curricula which were developed and implemented between 2001 and 2017. The goal of this review is to apply the lessons learned from a range of climate change-focused curricula to new, regionally or sector-specific educational programs targeting both agricultural advisers and innovative farmers. Our findings suggest that developers of future educational programs consider the following: (a) the specific needs of their audience, including topical interests and learning needs; (b) the use of interdisciplinary teams for curricula development; (c) trade-offs associated with inclusivity and depth of course content; and (d) the advantages of project-based education approaches suited for adult learning audiences. By applying these concepts to future curricula, these curricula are likely to have the greatest level of impact.

Calibration and validation of SWAT were performed using monthly stream flows for 1968-1987 and 1988-1997, respectively. The R2 and Nash-Sutcliffe simulation efficiency values computed for the monthly comparisons were 0.74 and 0.69 for the calibration period and 0.82 and 0.81 for the validation period. The effects of nine 30-year (1968 to 1997) sensitivity runs and six climate change scenarios were then analyzed, relative to a scenario baseline. A doubling of atmospheric CO2 to 660 ppmv (while holding other climate variables constant) resulted in a 36 percent increase in average annual streamflow while average annual flow changes of -49, -26, 28, and 58 percent were predicted for precipitation change scenarios of -20, -10, 10, and 20 percent, respectively. Mean annual streamflow changes of 51, 10, 2, -6, 38, and 27 percent were predicted by SWAT in response to climate change projections generated from the CISRO-RegCM2, CCC, CCSR, CISRO-Mk2, GFDL, and HadCM3 general circulation model scenarios. High seasonal variability was also predicted within individual climate change scenarios and large variability was indicated between scenarios within specific months. Overall, the climate change scenarios reveal a large degree of uncertainty in current climate change forecasts for the region. The results also indicate that the simulated UMRB hydrology is very sensitive to current forecasted future climate changes.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aclimate change 3arivers 3awatersheds 3astream flow 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3acalibration 3amodel validation 3asimulation models 3ahydrologic cycle 3aseasonal variation 3atime series analysis 3aMinnesota 3aWisconsin 3aIowa 3aIllinois 3aMissouri1 aArnold, J.G.1 aGassman, P.W.1 aGiorgi, F.1 aGu, R.R.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2006 Aug., v.  42, no.  4 p.997-1015x1093-474X7nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl55232  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb04510.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73903Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl55232b1093-474Xc42d4e997  fJournal of the American Water Resources Association  aissued  a20071128b20071210c00000000  aIND438422659ExL  aINDdGAYe2006/11/15  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20071128 20071210 00000000bIND GAY 2006/11/15  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:7390  a2010-02-13  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a384226504168nab a2200709 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098024003000125035002800155040001800183100011100201245019400312300001600506500002000522506002800542506003000570520165600600592002802256593001802284596007202302596006002374506003702434650002702471650002602498650002002524650001402544650001902558650000902577650001302586650001202599650001102611650001302622650001202635650001102647650002202658650001502680651001102695773012802706787003302834787001802867787002402885856007302909903002202982912001203004914004603016914003103062916001503093917001103108918004303119935002203162949001503184953005703199954006103256955003403317961001203351962004803363974001703411983001503428984001503443991591842030742620221207080020.0180609e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059602872DNAL7 a10.1111/eff.123862doi7 a10.1111/eff.123862chorus  aagid:5960287-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowell, Philip J.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Forestry and Range Sciences Laboratory, La Grande, OR, USA10aChanges in native bull trout and non‐native brook trout distributions in the upper Powder River basin after 20 years, relationships to water temperature and implications of climate change  ap. 710-719.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aMany bull trout populations have declined from non‐native brook trout introductions, habitat changes (e.g. water temperature) and other factors. We systematically sampled the distribution of bull trout and brook trout in the upper Powder River basin in Oregon in the 1990s and resampled it in 2013–2015, examined temperature differences in the habitats of the two species and analysed trends in temperatures in the light of possible increases associated with climate change. The species’ distributions are currently similar to those in the 1990s, except in one stream where bull trout declined. However, bull trout consisting of resident forms remain restricted to a few kilometres of habitat at the upper end of fish distribution. In streams where both species occur, the typical pattern was an intermediate zone of mixed bull trout, brook trout, and hybrids downstream of allopatric bull trout and allopatric brook trout extending farther downstream. Temperature differences between where bull trout and most brook trout occurred were small (0.5–1.0°C August mean). There were no statistical increases in water temperatures in nearby streams since the 1990s and no warming trends in air temperatures for the past 25–60 years. However, peak summer water temperatures are occurring about 3 weeks earlier than 25 years ago. Future effects of climate change, including possible increases in temperature, changes in timing and other factors (e.g. snowpack, flow and extreme events) remain a concern for the persistence of these populations. However, it is difficult to precisely predict where those changes will occur and what they will be.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cBonneville Power Administrationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100015704  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000069590 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalvelinus confluentus 3aSalvelinus fontinalis 3aair temperature 3aallopatry 3aclimate change 3afish 3ahabitats 3ahybrids 3arivers 3asnowpack 3astreams 3asummer 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3aOregon0 tEcology of freshwater fish.g2018 July, v. 27, no. 3 p.710-719dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895938x0906-66917nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl389593840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.123863Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3895938b0906-6691c27d3e710  fEcology of freshwater fish  aBatch:2004  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6059602879ExL  a2020-03-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/09066691_2018_27_3.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/09066691_2018_27_3.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2004 reviewed on 2018-07-13T04:00:03Z  aagid:5960287  a2018-06-09  a2020-03-0604203nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024001700121024003600138024002200174024001900196035002800215040001800243100011600261245007100377300001300448506007600461506017300537520133200710593001802042593002002060595005102080506003702131593002002168650001902188650001902207650002502226650000902251650002202260650001302282650002302295650001802318651001102336700012202347700012602469700010802595773008702703787003302790787001802823787001902841856011402860856008202974912001203056914003803068914002303106916001603129917001103145935002203156949001503178952001503193956008303208961000903291962003003300974001703330983001503347984001503362985011603377986001203493991591892650742620221214224714.0180723e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064723652DNAL7 a10113/64723652hdl7 a3434872aris7 a10.1038/s41598-017-08298-y2doi7 aPMC55578792pmcid7 a288115122pmid  aagid:6472365-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmagro, AndréeauthoruFederal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, CxP 549, Campo Grande, MS, 79070-900, Brazil10aProjected climate change impacts in rainfall erosivity over Brazil  ap. 1-12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe impacts of climate change on soil erosion may bring serious economic, social and environmental problems. However, few studies have investigated these impacts on continental scales. Here we assessed the influence of climate change on rainfall erosivity across Brazil. We used observed rainfall data and downscaled climate model output based on Hadley Center Global Environment Model version 2 (HadGEM2-ES) and Model for Interdisciplinary Research On Climate version 5 (MIROC5), forced by Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5, to estimate and map rainfall erosivity and its projected changes across Brazil. We estimated mean values of 10,437 mm ha-1 h-1 year-1 for observed data (1980-2013) and 10,089 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 year-1 and 10,585 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 year-1 for HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5, respectively (1961-2005). Our analysis suggests that the most affected regions, with projected rainfall erosivity increases ranging up to 109% in the period 2007-2040, are northeastern and southern Brazil. Future decreases of as much as -71% in the 2071-2099 period were estimated for the southeastern, central and northwestern parts of the country. Our results provide an overview of rainfall erosivity in Brazil that may be useful for planning soil and water conservation, and for promoting water and food security.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  a393bllucasc2020-03-18damanda.xue2020-04-140 fUnrestricted online access2star  eARIS manuscript 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aenvironmental impact 3arain 3asoil conservation 3asoil map 3awater conservation 3awater erosion 3aBrazil1 aOliveira, Paulo TarsoeauthoruFederal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, CxP 549, Campo Grande, MS, 79070-900, Brazil1 aNearing, MarkeauthoruUSDA-ARS, Southwest Watershed Research Center, 2000 E.

We assessed climate change impacts on corn production at Bushland in the NHP region using the CERES-Maize model under 36 future climate scenarios. These scenarios included nine global climate models (GCMs), two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, and two future time periods 2050s (2036–2065) and 2080s (2066–2095). Simulated grain corn yield decreased, under all scenarios in the future, by approximately 31 % on average in the 2050s and by approximately 55 % in the 2080s, under RCP 8.5, mainly due to reduced unit grain weight and biomass, and shorter crop cycle. Seasonal irrigation water use was simulated to either increase or decrease in the future depending on the rainfall projection of a GCM. Adaptation strategies considered in this study included using ideotypes with a longer maturity, higher yield potential, and greater heat tolerance than the reference cultivar, and shifting of planting dates. The ideotypes were created by modifying thermal times from emergence to end-of-juvenile phase, thermal time from silking to maturity, maximum kernel number per plant, radiation use efficiency (RUE), and optimum and failure temperature thresholds during relative grain filling. The planting dates considered were 16 April, 1 May, 16 May (reference), 1 June, and 16 June. By increasing the reproductive period by 13 days, grain yield could increase by 40 %, but that could increase seasonal irrigation water requirement by 10 %. Grain corn yield increased by 13 % on average when the maximum number of kernels per plant or RUE were increased by 15 %, with minor changes in seasonal irrigation water requirement. Heat tolerant ideotypes showed yield advantage over the reference cultivar without much change in irrigation. Delayed planting increased grain yield in the future. Overall, grain yield could decline under climate change without adaptation. Ideotypes with greater silking to maturity period, potential number of kernels per plant, RUE, and heat tolerance during grain filling, showed yield benefits in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrop Environment Resource Synthesis models 3aZea mays 3abiomass 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acultivars 3agrain yield 3aheat tolerance 3aideotypes 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3aradiation use efficiency 3arain 3arisk management 3aseeds 3atemperature 3awater requirement 3aTexas 0aDSSAT 0aCERES-Maize 0aHeat tolerance 0aIdeotype 0aPlanting date 0aSemi-arid region1 aAle, SrinivasulueauthoruDepartment of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA1 aMarek, Gary W.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, 300 Simmons Rd, Unit 10, Bushland, TX 79012, USA1 aMunster, Clyde L.eauthoruDepartment of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA1 aSingh, Vijay P.eauthoruDepartment of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA1 aChen, YongeauthoruCollege of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, 2 Yuanmingyuan W.

Additionally, forest managers face increasing challenges to sustaining forests in the face of high uncertainty associated with response to climate change. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project was developed to provide operational-scale research opportunities to assess and demonstrate various adaptation approaches to forest management in regionally important forest types. The ASCC project framework includes three treatments (resistance, resilience, and transition) representing a gradient of silvicultural approaches aimed at climate change. The first of five ASCC installations is located on the Cutfoot Experimental Forest-Chippewa National Forest (CEF), Minnesota USA, in a mixed-species northern pine forest. Using habitat suitability models under projected future climates, as well as expert opinion, we chose eight future climate-adapted species for planting as part of the transition treatment, consisting of four native species to the CEF: eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.), northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa Michx.), and red maple (Acer rubrum L.); and four novel species to the CEF: white oak (Quercus alba L.), bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis Wangenh.), black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson). The seedlings were planted under two canopy conditions, a thinned matrix (14–18 m² ha⁻¹ residual basal area) and 0.2-ha gap openings (through harvesting). We measured how overstory canopy conditions (gap openings versus a thinned matrix) and understory shrub/herbaceous cover affect species performance. We measured 45 plots over the course of three growing seasons (Spring 2016 – Fall 2018), taking measurements of seedling basal diameter and survival, as well as estimates of understory vegetation density. Our findings highlight strong variations in species performance across treatment conditions. While overstory canopy condition was found to be a weak predictor of seedling survival and growth, our results show post-treatment colonization of understory shrub/herbaceous cover being a strong predictor of seedling survival (p < 0.001), with 86.67% (±8.04; 1 standard error) of seedlings surviving in the lowest understory cover class, and 74.23% (±3.04) surviving in the highest understory cover class. Seedling growth did not appear affected by understory shrub/herbaceous cover. Additionally, growth and survival varied significantly among native and novel seedlings, with ponderosa pine exhibiting the highest growth rates at 0.31 cm cm⁻¹ year⁻¹ (±0.004), while also having the lowest survival of any species at 45.66% (±1.2). Results from this study can be directly used by managers to inform planting decisions and species selections that align with management planning to promote forest health and sustainably in the face of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNorthern Research Stationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100014511  cUniversity of Minnesotadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000072490 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcer rubrum 3aCarya cordiformis 3aPinus ponderosa 3aPinus strobus 3aPrunus serotina 3aQuercus alba 3aQuercus macrocarpa 3aQuercus rubra 3aautumn 3acanopy 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconiferous forests 3aecosystems 3aexpert opinion 3aforest health 3aforest management 3agrowing season 3ahabitats 3aharvesting 3aindigenous species 3alatitude 3amodels 3anational forests 3aoverstory 3aplanning 3aplanting 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3asilviculture 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aunderstory 3aMinnesota 0aForest adaptation 0aClimate change 0aSilviculture 0aFuture-adapted 0aSeedling survival 0aSeedling growth1 aNagel, Linda M.eauthoruForest and Rangeland Stewardship Department, Colorado State University, 1472 Campus Delivery, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA1 aPalik, Brian J.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Forestry Sciences Laboratory, 1831 Hwy. 169.

Understanding how land‐use and climate factors interact is critical to predicting and managing pollinator populations and ensuring adequate pollination services, but most studies have evaluated either land‐use or climate effects, not both. Furthermore, bee species are incredibly variable, spanning an array of behavioral, physiological, and life‐history traits that can increase or decrease resilience to land‐use or climate change. Thus, there are likely bee species that benefit, while others suffer, from changing climate and land use, but few studies have documented taxon‐specific trends. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we analyzed a long‐term dataset of wild bee occurrences from Maryland, Delaware, and Washington DC, USA, examining how different bee genera and functional groups respond to landscape composition, quality, and climate factors. Despite a large body of literature documenting land‐use effects on wild bees, in this study, climate factors emerged as the main drivers of wild‐bee abundance and richness. For wild‐bee communities in spring and summer/fall, temperature and precipitation were more important predictors than landscape composition, landscape quality, or topography. However, relationships varied substantially between wild‐bee genera and functional groups. In the Northeast USA, past trends and future predictions show a changing climate with warmer winters, more intense precipitation in winter and spring, and longer growing seasons with higher maximum temperatures. In almost all of our analyses, these conditions were associated with lower abundance of wild bees. Wild‐bee richness results were more mixed, including neutral and positive relationships with predicted temperature and precipitation patterns. Thus, in this region and undoubtedly more broadly, changing climate poses a significant threat to wild‐bee communities.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aPENW‐2017‐07007cUnited States Department of Agriculture National Institute for Food and Agriculture  aPEN04606cUnited States Department of Agriculture National Institute for Food and Agriculture  a1009362cUnited States Department of Agriculture National Institute for Food and Agriculture  a54903cFoundation for Food and Agriculture Research  cPennsylvania State University Intercollege Graduate Degree Program in Ecology 3abees 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alife history 3apollination 3apollinators 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3atopography 3awinter 3aDelaware 3aMaryland1 aGoslee, Sarah C.eauthoruUSDA‐ARS Pasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit, University Park, PA, USA1 aDouglas, Margaret R.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental Studies & Environmental Science, Dickinson College, Carlisle, PA, USA1 aTooker, John F.eauthoruIntercollege Graduate Degree Program in Ecology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA1 aGrozinger, Christina M.eauthoruIntercollege Graduate Degree Program in Ecology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA0 tGlobal change biology.g2021 Mar., v. 27, no. 6 p.1250-1265dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.154853Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c27d6e1250  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:10149  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6072816019ExL  a2021-06-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13541013_2021_27_6.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13541013_2021_27_6.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:7281601  a2021-02-17  a2021-06-1804293nab a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100017600179245010700355300001600462520158600478592002802064593001802092650001902110650001902129650001502148650001102163650002002174650002602194651001002220700019802230700014802428700014302576700017202719700017402891773011503065787003303180787001803213787002103231856008203252912001203334914004603346914002003392916001503412917001103427918002903438935002203467949001503489953006703504954005903571955003703630961001303667974001703680983001503697984001503712991592310110742620221117090356.0190405e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061080922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-018-2243-x2doi  aagid:6108092-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, ZhijuaneauthoruCollege of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, No. 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd., Haidian District, Beijing, 100193, China10aClimate zones determine where substantial increases of maize yields can be attained in Northeast China  ap. 473-487.  aAs the growth in global population has led to greater demands for food and energy, societies have been pressured to increase food production. Closing the gap between current and potential yields is one means of producing more food. In this study, we first identify the gaps between the potential yield and actual on-farm yield of maize for ten climate zones (CZs) in Northeast China (NEC) from 1961 to 2010. We then use trend analysis to assess yield gaps caused by suboptimal water availability (YGw). Finally, we identify the CZs where maize yields could be increased through improved irrigation management. Nonparametric trend analysis showed an estimated regional area-averaged yield gap of 64% between potential yield and actual on-farm yield; this gap decreased by 11.0% per decade over the study period (p < 0.01). Although yield gaps have fallen to 43% during the past decade, on-farm maize yield still accounts for only 57% of potential yield. Therefore, there is still a considerable yield gap in maize production in NEC. Simulation results indicated that the average YGw of 23% in NEC is due to suboptimal water availability. Moreover, in CZs with a positive water deficit, the YGw ranged from 14 to 48%; in the remaining CZs, the YGw ranged from 5 to 13%. We conclude that there are substantial opportunities to increase maize production by up to 2.8 t ha⁻¹ through improved irrigation management in cases where the limited irrigation resources can be improved, especially in CZs that receive less than 450 mm of precipitation during the maize-growing season.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate change 3aclimatic zones 3acrop yield 3aenergy 3afood production 3airrigation management 3aChina1 aYang, XiaoguangeauthoruCollege of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, No. 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd., Haidian District, Beijing, 100193, China. yangxg@cau.edu.cn1 aLin, XiaomaoeauthoruDepartment of Agronomy, Kansas State University, 2108 Throckmorton Hall, Plant Sciences Center, Manhattan, KS, 66506, USA1 aGowda, PrasannaeauthoruForage and Livestock Production Research Unit, USDA-ARS Grazinglands Research Laboratory, El Reno, OK, 73036, USA1 aLv, ShuoeauthoruCollege of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, No. 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd., Haidian District, Beijing, 100193, China1 aWang, JingeauthoruCollege of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, No. 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd., Haidian District, Beijing, 100193, China0 tClimatic change.g2018 Aug., v. 149, no. 3-4 p.473-487dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-018-2243-x3Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c149d3-4e473  fClimatic change  aBatch:2071  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6061080929ExL  a2019-04-05  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_19-04-05_05-35-16.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/10584-149-3-4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6108092  a2019-04-05  a2019-04-0504922nab a2200937 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024003100115024002300146024002800169024001200197035002800209040001800237100002800255245013200283300001600415506017300431520163100604592002802235593001802263593002002281595005302301596001802354593002002372650001602392650002002408650003002428650001202458650001902470650001902489650002702508650001602535650001002551650002402561650001302585650001502598650001502613650001902628650001102647650001902658650001402677650001802691650001502709651001602724651002202740700002502762700002702787700002302814700003002837700002202867700002502889773016402914787003303078787001803111787001803129787002203147856011403169856007503283912001203358914001703370914002103387914003903408916001503447917001103462918002903473935002203502949001503524953002403539954005903563955003203622956017603654961001703830962003003847962004803877974001703925983001503942984001503957986001203972991592909950742620221214230221.0220714s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057227612DNAL7 a3319932aris7 a10.13031/aea.120472chorus7 a10113/57227612hdl7 a10.13031/aea.120472doi8 ans13043  aagid:5722761-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasarer, L M.W.eauthor10aClimate Change Impacts on Runoff, Sediment, and Nutrient Loads in an Agricultural Watershedin the Lower Mississippi River Basin  ap. 379-392.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aProjected climate change can impact various aspects of agricultural systems, including the nutrient and sediment loads exported from agricultural fields. This study evaluated the potential changes in runoff, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads using projected climate estimates from 2041-2070 in the Beasley Lake watershed in Mississippi, USA, using the Annualized Agricultural Non-Point Source (AnnAGNPS) pollution watershed model. For baseline conditions and model inputs an earlier validated simulation of the watershed was used with an event-based NSE of 0.81 for runoff and 0.54 for sediment without calibration. Fifteen global climate models (GCMs) for the climate change scenario RCP8.5 in Western Mississippi were used. Daily precipitation and air temperature were generated with the weather generator SYNTOR. Daily climate data derived from all 15 GCMS were used in AnnAGNPS simulations to generate ensemble projected loads, and climate data from four GCMs were used in simulations to assess the effectiveness of five different conservation practices for reducing projected loads. Predicted median annual-average pollutant loads increased by 9% to 12% with ensemble projected climate change. However, no-tillage and cover crop conservation practices were predicted to reduce pollutant loads from 20% to 75% below historical levels despite the impacts of climate change. This study suggests that greater implementation of conservation practices can be effective at mitigating water quality degradation associated with projected climate change.

Currently, management approaches are being proposed that intend to (1) mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon stores and (2) foster adaptation by maintaining compositionally and structurally complex forests. However, little is known about the compatibility of these two objectives or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, we examined stand-level carbon and complexity responses using five long-term (>50yrs) silviculture experiments within the upper Great Lakes region, USA. In particular, live tree carbon stores and sequestration rates, and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiments in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiments in northern hardwood systems to elucidate the long-term effects of management on these ecosystem attributes and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objectives. As expected, we observed a general increase in large tree densities with stand age and positive relationships between stand stocking level and live tree carbon stores. More importantly, our results clearly identify tradeoffs between the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives across each study. For example, maintaining higher stocking levels (i.e., enhanced mitigation by increasing carbon stores) resulted in decreases in stand-level structural and compositional complexity (i.e., reduced adaptation potential). In addition, rates of live tree carbon increment were also the lowest within the highest stocking levels; despite the benefits of these stand conditions to maximizing carbon stores. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of avoiding rigid adherence to a single objective, such as maximum on-site carbon stores, without recognizing potential consequences to other ecosystem components crucial to ensuring long-term ecosystem functioning within the context of environmental change. One potential stand-level strategy for balancing these goals may be to employ multi-aged management systems, such as irregular shelterwood and selection systems, that maintain a large proportion of carbon stores in retained mature trees while using thinning to create spatial heterogeneity that promotes higher sequestration rates in smaller, younger trees and simultaneously enhances structural and compositional complexity.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aretained trees 3aselection methods 3along term experiments 3ahardwood 3along term effects 3amanagement systems 3aecosystem management 3aclimate change 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aforest management 3ashelterwood systems 3astand density 3aPinus resinosa 3arisk reduction 3aforests 3aGreat Lakes region 3aUnited States 0aadaptation1 aBradford, John B.eauthoruUSDA, Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Grand Rapids, MN 55744, USA1 aFraver, ShawneauthoruUSDA, Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Grand Rapids, MN 55744, USA1 aPalik, Brian J.eauthoruUSDA, Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Grand Rapids, MN 55744, USA0 tForest ecology and management.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 262, no. 5 p.803-816dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl901340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl9013b0378-1127c262d5e803  fForest ecology and management  aissued2 aElsevier B.V.eprovider5DNAL  aIND445909359ExL  a2013-09-18  aNAL270800378112702620005.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:346 annotated on 2013-09-04T16:17:28Z  aBatch:346 reviewed on 2013-09-18T15:00:02Z  aBatch:346 reviewed on 2013-09-18T16:00:02Z  aagid:403361  a2014-11-11  a2014-11-11  a459093504213nab a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100013100171245010500302300001600407520221800423592002802641593001802669650004102687650001302728650001202741650001902753650001102772650001202783650002202795650002202817650001402839650002402853650002202877650001102899650001602910650001102926700003702937700002802974700003303002773009803035787003303133787001803166787002203184856007303206912001203279914004403291914002603335916001403361917001103375918004303386935002203429949001503451953002703466961001203493962004703505974001703552983001503569984001503584991593426970742620221116223759.0150522e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013585682DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.127192doi  aagid:1358568-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBansal, SheeleauthoruPacific Northwest Research Station, USDA‐Forest Service, 3625 93rd Avenue SW, Olympia, WA, 98512, USA10aClimate‐related genetic variation in drought‐resistance of Douglas‐fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)  ap. 947-958.  aThere is a general assumption that intraspecific populations originating from relatively arid climates will be better adapted to cope with the expected increase in drought from climate change. For ecologically and economically important species, more comprehensive, genecological studies that utilize large distributions of populations and direct measures of traits associated with drought‐resistance are needed to empirically support this assumption because of the implications for the natural or assisted regeneration of species. We conducted a space‐for‐time substitution, common garden experiment with 35 populations of coast Douglas‐fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) growing at three test sites with distinct summer temperature and precipitation (referred to as ‘cool/moist’, ‘moderate’, or ‘warm/dry’) to test the hypotheses that (i) there is large genetic variation among populations and regions in traits associated with drought‐resistance, (ii) the patterns of genetic variation are related to the native source‐climate of each population, in particular with summer temperature and precipitation, (iii) the differences among populations and relationships with climate are stronger at the warm/dry test site owing to greater expression of drought‐resistance traits (i.e., a genotype × environment interaction). During midsummer 2012, we measured the rate of water loss after stomatal closure (transpirationₘᵢₙ), water deficit (% below turgid saturation), and specific leaf area (SLA, cm² g⁻¹) on new growth of sapling branches. There was significant genetic variation in all plant traits, with populations originating from warmer and drier climates having greater drought‐resistance (i.e., lower transpirationₘᵢₙ, water deficit and SLA), but these trends were most clearly expressed only at the warm/dry test site. Contrary to expectations, populations from cooler climates also had greater drought‐resistance across all test sites.

Forest landscape models (FLM) are used by managers and policy‐makers to make projections of future ecosystem dynamics under alternative management or policy options, but the links between the fundamental drivers and projected responses are weak and indirect, limiting their reliability for projecting the impacts of climate change. We developed and tested a relatively mechanistic method to simulate the effects of changing precipitation on species competition within the LANDIS‐II FLM. Using data from a field precipitation manipulation experiment in a piñon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) ecosystem in New Mexico (USA), we calibrated our model to measurements from ambient control plots and tested predictions under the drought and irrigation treatments against empirical measurements. The model successfully predicted behavior of physiological variables under the treatments. Discrepancies between model output and empirical data occurred when the monthly time step of the model failed to capture the short‐term dynamics of the ecosystem as recorded by instantaneous field measurements. We applied the model to heuristically assess the effect of alternative climate scenarios on the piñon–juniper ecosystem and found that warmer and drier climate reduced productivity and increased the risk of drought‐induced mortality, especially for piñon. We concluded that the direct links between fundamental drivers and growth rates in our model hold great promise to improve our understanding of ecosystem processes under climate change and improve management decisions because of its greater reliance on first principles.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aJuniperus monosperma 3aPinus edulis 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecophysiology 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3airrigation 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3amodels 3amortality 3aprediction 3arisk 3atemperature 3aNew Mexico1 aDe Bruijn, Arjan M.

To help decipher their relative importance during Euro‐American times, we employed a unique approach whereby tree species/genera were partitioned into temperature, shade tolerance, and pyrogenicity classes and applied to comparative tree‐census data. Our megadata analysis of 190 datasets determined the relative impacts of climate vs. altered disturbance regimes for various biomes across the eastern United States. As the Euro‐American period (ca. 1500 to today) spans two major climatic periods, from Little Ice Age to the Anthropocene, vegetation changes consistent with warming were expected. In most cases, however, European disturbance overrode regional climate, but in a manner that varied across the Tension Zone Line. To the north, intensive and expansive early European disturbance resulted in the ubiquitous loss of conifers and large increases of Acer, Populus, and Quercus in northern hardwoods, whereas to the south, these disturbances perpetuated the dominance of Quercus in central hardwoods. Acer increases and associated mesophication in Quercus‐Pinus systems were delayed until mid 20th century fire suppression. This led to significant warm to cool shifts in temperature class where cool‐adapted Acer saccharum increased and temperature neutral changes where warm‐adapted Acer rubrum increased. In both cases, these shifts were attributed to fire suppression rather than climate change. Because mesophication is ongoing, eastern US forests formed during the catastrophic disturbance era followed by fire suppression will remain in climate disequilibrium into the foreseeable future. Overall, the results of our study suggest that altered disturbance regimes rather than climate had the greatest influence on vegetation composition and dynamics in the eastern United States over multiple centuries. Land‐use change often trumped or negated the impacts of warming climate, and needs greater recognition in climate change discussions, scenarios, and model interpretations.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aAcer rubrum 3aAcer saccharum 3aPopulus 3aQuercus 3abotanical composition 3aclimate 3aconifers 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afire suppression 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3ahardwood 3aland use change 3ashade tolerance 3atemperature 3aEastern United States1 aAbrams, Marc D.eauthor0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.314-334dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.126633Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c21d1e314  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:949  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6013585279ExL  a2015-06-23  a13541013_2015_21_1.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:949 reviewed on 2015-06-23T11:00:02Z  aagid:1358527  a2015-05-22  a2015-06-2304191nab a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002600098035002800124040001800152100016600170245012500336500002000461520188900481592002802370593001802398596010202416650001702518650001302535650000902548650001902557650001302576650001902589650001002608650001802618650001602636650001302652651001202665700012402677700012202801773010802923787003303031787001803064787002203082856007303104912001203177914004803189914001203237916001603249917001103265918004303276935002203319949001503341952001903356953005803375954006203433955003403495961001303529974001703542983001503559984001503574991593735500742620221117035750.0220202e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076575902DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.35982doi  aagid:7657590-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCabe, Lindsie M.eauthoruDepartment of Biological Sciences, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, 86011, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9815-058110aDecreased bee emergence along an elevation gradient: Implications for climate change revealed by a transplant experiment  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBees experience differences in thermal tolerance based on their geographical range; however, there are virtually no studies that examine how overwintering temperatures may influence immature survival rates. Here, we conducted a transplant experiment along an elevation gradient to test for climate‐change effects on immature overwinter survival using movement along elevational gradient for a community of 26 cavity‐nesting bee species in the family Megachilidae along the San Francisco Peaks, Arizona elevational gradient. In each of three years, we placed nest blocks at three elevations, to be colonized by native Megachilidae. Colonized blocks were then (1) moved to lower (warmer) elevations; (2) moved to higher (cooler) elevations; or (3) left in their natal habitat (no change in temperature). Because Megachilidae occupy high elevations with colder temperatures more than any other family of bees, we predicted that emergence would decrease in nest blocks moved to lower elevations, but that we would find no differences in emergence when nest blocks were moved to higher elevations. We found three major results: (1) Bee species moved to lower (warmer) habitats exhibited a 30% decrease in emergence compared with species moved within their natal habitat. (2) Habitat generalists were more likely than habitat specialists to emerge when moved up or down in elevation regardless of their natal life zones. (3) At our highest elevation treatment, emergence increased when blocks were moved to higher elevations, indicating that at least some Megachilidae species can survive at colder temperatures. Our results suggest that direct effects of warming temperatures will have negative impacts on the overall survival of Megachilidae. Additionally, above the tree line, low availability of wood‐nesting resources is a probable limiting factor on bees moving up in elevation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Science Foundation’s Integrative Graduate Education, Research, and Traineeship Program 3aMegachilidae 3aaltitude 3abees 3aclimate change 3ahabitats 3aheat tolerance 3anests 3aoverwintering 3atemperature 3atreeline 3aArizona1 aAslan, Clare E.eauthoruLandscape Conservation Initiative, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, 86011, USA1 aCobb, Neil S.eauthoruDepartment of Biological Sciences, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, 86011, USA0 tEcology.g2022 Feb., v. 103, no. 2 p.e03598-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4616440uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.35983Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46164b0012-9658c103d2ee03598  fEcology  aBatch:10229  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6076575909ExL  a2022-02-23  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/00129658_2022_103_2.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/00129658_2022_103_2.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:7657590  a2022-02-02  a2022-02-2104103nab a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004200098035002800140040001800168100009800186245008300284300001800367500002000385520179000405592002802195593001802223596001702241596001702258650002402275650001102299650001202310650002102322650001902343650001302362650001802375650001202393650000902405650001402414650001402428650001602442650001002458651002602468700011002494700010502604773012302709787003302832787001802865787002202883856008802905912001202993914004503005914002603050916001503076917001103091918004303102935002203145949001503167953005703182954006103239955003403300961001203334962004803346974001703394983001503411984001503426991593894050742620221117064859.0191122e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067689962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02571.x2doi  aagid:6768996-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, KaieauthoruNicholas School of the Environment, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA10aFailure to migrate: lack of tree range expansion in response to climate change  ap. 1042-1052.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTree species are expected to track warming climate by shifting their ranges to higher latitudes or elevations, but current evidence of latitudinal range shifts for suites of species is largely indirect. In response to global warming, offspring of trees are predicted to have ranges extend beyond adults at leading edges and the opposite relationship at trailing edges. Large‐scale forest inventory data provide an opportunity to compare present latitudes of seedlings and adult trees at their range limits. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we directly compared seedling and tree 5th and 95th percentile latitudes for 92 species in 30 longitudinal bands for 43 334 plots across the eastern United States. We further compared these latitudes with 20th century temperature and precipitation change and functional traits, including seed size and seed spread rate. Results suggest that 58.7% of the tree species examined show the pattern expected for a population undergoing range contraction, rather than expansion, at both northern and southern boundaries. Fewer species show a pattern consistent with a northward shift (20.7%) and fewer still with a southward shift (16.3%). Only 4.3% are consistent with expansion at both range limits. When compared with the 20th century climate changes that have occurred at the range boundaries themselves, there is no consistent evidence that population spread is greatest in areas where climate has changed most; nor are patterns related to seed size or dispersal characteristics. The fact that the majority of seedling extreme latitudes are less than those for adult trees may emphasize the lack of evidence for climate‐mediated migration, and should increase concerns for the risks posed by climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  a0940671cNSF  cCoweeta LTER 3aUSDA Forest Service 3aadults 3aclimate 3aforest inventory 3aglobal warming 3alatitude 3amature plants 3aprogeny 3arisk 3aseed size 3aseedlings 3atemperature 3atrees 3aEastern United States1 aWoodall, Christopher W.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, St. Paul, MN, 55108, USA1 aClark, James S.eauthoruNicholas School of the Environment, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA0 tGlobal change biology.g2012 Mar., v. 18, no. 3 p.1042-1052dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02571.x3Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c18d3e1042  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:2438  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6067689969ExL  a2020-04-09  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13541013_2012_18_3.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13541013_2012_18_3.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2438 reviewed on 2020-04-09T11:00:14Z  aagid:6768996  a2019-11-22  a2020-04-0903765nab a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002100115024003600136035002600172040001800198100002600216245009100242300001600333506017300349520110000522593001801622593002001640594002201660595005501682593002001737650001101757650001101768650001901779650001601798650002001814650001101834650002501845650001701870650002901887650002101916650001501937650001201952650002301964650001901987650001602006650002302022655000902045700003002054700002602084700002702110773011902137787003302256787001802289856011202307856004902419912001202468914004402480916001502524917001102539935002202550949001502572956018502587961000902772962003002781962004802811974001502859983001502874984001502889985011602904986001103020991593894600742620221214224045.0151014s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000616132DNAL7 a3035162aris7 a10113/616132hdl7 a10.1079/9781780644325.02632doi  aagid:61613-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, Natashaeauthor10aIonophores: A tool for improving ruminant production and reducing environmental impact  ap. 263-272.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aRuminal fermentation is an inherently inefficient process converting up to 12% of dietary carbon and energy into end products (e.g. CH4) that are largely unusable by the animal. Ruminant nutritionists seek to modify fermentation, specifically by increasing ruminal propionic acid yield, reducing methanogenesis and decreasing ruminal proteolysis and deamination of dietary proteins in order to improve production efficiency. To date, a variety of methods have been investigated in an eff ort to meet these objectives. Carboxylic polyether compounds, ‘ionophores’, are an effective means of decreasing enteric CH4 emissions when included in ruminant diets. Although ruminant nutritionists have historically focused on feeding ionophores to increase efficiency and profitability, recent attention has focused on the ability of ionophores to impact global greenhouse gas production. Th is chapter examines the use of ionophores in cattle diets for the mitigation of enteric CH4 production. Issues like ionophore resistance and the impact of ionophore feeding on human health are also addressed.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article  a594bjgilbertc2015-12-01dfedoraAdmine2015-12-02  eARIS manuscript 3acarbon 3acattle 3acattle feeding 3adeamination 3adietary protein 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afermentation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aionophores 3amethane 3amethane production 3apropionic acid 3aproteolysis 3arumen fermentation 7abook1 aWickersham, Tryoneauthor1 aSharma, Vijayeauthor1 aCallaway, Toddeauthor0 tLivestock production and climate change.g2015, ch. 17 p.263-272dCAB InternationalwSource:1z97817806443257nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/616133Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/9781780644325.0263  aArticle  fLivestock production and climate change  aBatch:1157  aissued  aIND6000616139ExL  a2016-01-05  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Ionophores%20A%20tool%20for%20improving%20ruminant%20production%20and%20reducing%20environmental%20impact.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:1157 reviewed on 2016-01-05T11:00:02Z  aagid:61613  a2015-10-14  a2016-01-05  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans855002824nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003800097024002100135035002600156040001800182072000900200072000900209072000900218072000900227072000900236100002500245245012000270300001600390500021000406500026200616500001500878593001800893593002000911650002700931650001800958650001800976650001300994650001001007650001901017650003101036650002601067650002901093650002001122650001701142650001801159650001701177650001201194653001901206700002101225700001501246773008401261787003301345787001801378787003001396787002201426852000901448856011201457856008801569912001201657914004501669914002801714917001101742930003301753935002101786945002501807946001101832949001501843952005101858961001201909974001501921984001501936985010301951986001202054991594071310742620221117183258.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441107202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2008.07.0132doi7 a10113/215922hdl  aagid:21592-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF300 0aK001 0aK800 0aF8411 aBytnerowicz, Andrzej10aIntroduction: Forests under anthropogenic pressure - Effects of air pollution, climate change and urban development  ap. 289-390.  aIn the special issue: Forests under Anthropogenic Pressure-Effects of Air Pollution, Climate Change and Urban Development / edited by A.

The model was first calibrated for a sorghum cultivar grown in a free air CO₂ enrichment experiment at the University of Arizona, Maricopa, Arizona, USA in 1998. The model was then validated with an independent dataset collected in 1999. The simulated grain yield, growth, and soil water of sorghum for the both years were in statistical agreement with the corresponding measurements, respectively. Neither simulated nor measured yields responded to elevated CO₂, but both were sensitive to water supply. The validated model was then applied to simulate possible effects of climate change on sorghum grain yield and water use efficiency in western North America for the years 2080-2100. The projected CO₂ fertilizer effect on grain yield was dominated by the adverse effect of projected temperature increases. Therefore, temperature appears to be a dominant driver of the global climate change influencing future sorghum productivity. These results suggest that an increase in water demand for sorghum production should be anticipated in a future high-CO₂ world.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aCrop Environment Resource Synthesis models 3aSorghum bicolor 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3afertilizers 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3agrain sorghum 3agrain yield 3asoil water 3atemperature 3awater supply 3awater use efficiency 3aArizona 0aclimate change 0acrop simulation 0aFACE 0agrain yield 0asorghum1 aKo, JonghaneauthoruDepartment of Applied Plant Science, Chonnam National University, 77 Youngbong-ro, Buk-gu, Gwangju 500-757, Korea1 aWall, Gerard W.eauthoruUS Arid Land Agricultural Research Center, USDA, Agricultural Research Service, 21881 North Cardon Lane, Maricopa, AZ 85138, USA1 aPinter, Paul J.eauthoruUS Arid Land Agricultural Research Center, USDA, Agricultural Research Service, 21881 North Cardon Lane, Maricopa, AZ 85138, USA1 aKimball, Bruce A.eauthoruUS Arid Land Agricultural Research Center, USDA, Agricultural Research Service, 21881 North Cardon Lane, Maricopa, AZ 85138, USA1 aOttman, Michael J.eauthoru Department of Plant Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA1 aKim, Han-YongeauthoruDepartment of Applied Plant Science, Chonnam National University, 77 Youngbong-ro, Buk-gu, Gwangju 500-757, Korea0 tInternational agrophysics.g2016 July 27, v. 30, no. 3 p.311-322dDe Gruyter Openx2300-87257nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2308540uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/intag-2016-00073Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:23085b2300-8725c30d3e311  fInternational agrophysics  aBatch:1571  aissued2 aDe Gruyter Publisherseprovider5DNAL  aIND6053698139ExL  a2017-03-28  aintag.2016.30.issue-3-1470421512330.zip  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:1571 reviewed on 2017-03-28T10:00:04Z  aagid:5369813  a2016-08-07  a2017-03-2805020nab a2200901 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004000098024003700138035002800175040001800203100014700221245017500368300001600543506007600559506003100635520165500666592002802321593001802349596008302367506003702450650003102487650002302518650001502541650002102556650004102577650001502618650003002633650001402663650001202677650001902689650001102708650001502719650001202734650002202746650001502768650002102783650002002804650002102824650001502845650001802860650002402878650001502902651001002917653000902927653001502936653001002951653002202961653001502983653002202998700009303020700009103113700010803204773011303312787003303425787001803458787002103476856008403497856004503581912001203626914004103638914003403679916001503713917001103728918003603739935002203775949001503797953007003812954007103882955004503953961000903998962004704007962001704054974001704071983001504088984001504103991594638320742620221215142345.0190403e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058319422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2017.07.0112chorus7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2017.07.0112doi  aagid:5831942-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, YongeauthoruTexas A&M AgriLife Research (Texas A&M University System), Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, Texas A&M University, USA10aModeling the effects of land use change from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to perennial bioenergy grasses on watershed hydrology and water quality under changing climate  ap. 198-208.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAssessing the impacts of biofuel-induced land use change on hydrology, water quality and crop yield under the current and future climate scenarios enables selection of appropriate land uses and associated best management practices under the changing climate. In this study, the impacts of land use change from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to perennial grasses in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the Texas High Plains were assessed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). While switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) was assumed to replace cotton in irrigated areas, dryland cotton was replaced by Miscanthus×giganteus under the hypothetical land use change scenarios. Climate change impacts were assessed based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate projections of 19 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 during two 30-year periods of middle (2040–2069) and end (2070–2099) of the 21st century. Median irrigation water use of cotton was simulated to decrease by 41%–61% in the future when compared to historic (1994–2009) period based on projections by 19 GCMs. Under the future climate change scenarios, when compared to cotton, median annual irrigation water use by switchgrass reduced by 62%–89%. Simulated future median total nitrogen load decreased by 30%–40% under perennial grasses when compared to future cotton land use. The median irrigated switchgrass yield decreased by 16%–28%, but the median dryland Miscanthus yield increased by 32%–38% under the future climate change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aMiscanthus 3aPanicum virgatum 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aarid lands 3abest management practices 3abioenergy 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acotton 3acrop yield 3agrasses 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3aland use change 3anitrogen content 3aperennials 3awater quality 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 3aTexas 0aSWAT 0aCrop yield 0aCMIP5 0aAlamo switchgrass 0aMiscanthus 0aTexas High Plains1 aAle, SrinivasulueauthoruTexas A&M AgriLife Research (Texas A&M University System), USA1 aRajan, NithyaeauthoruDepartment of Soil and Crop Sciences, Texas A&M University, USA1 aSrinivasan, RaghavaneauthoruDepartment of Ecosystem Science and Management, Texas A&M University, USA0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 Oct., v. 192 p.198-208dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.07.0113Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5831942  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774c192e198  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:1853  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6058319429ExL  a2019-04-03  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00067-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S0378377417302408.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1873-2283  aMissing ISSN  aagid:5831942  a2019-04-03  a2022-09-0203710nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003300098035002800131040001800159100018400177245009300361300001600454520124200470592002801712593001801740650002601758650002401784650002301808650001901831650001001850650001801860650001901878650001501897650002501912650001801937650002401955650002201979650002202001650001302023650001802036650002202054650001902076700002902095700003102124700003002155700002802185700003002213773013002243787003302373787001802406787001902424856007902443912001202522914004002534914001302574916001502587917001102602918006702613935002202680949001502702953007102717954007502788955004102863961001302904962004802917974001702965983001502982984001502997991594747100742620221117070540.0190614e20130510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064688912DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy30204332doi  aagid:6468891-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorch, Timothy G.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Tropical Agriculture Research Station (TARS), 2200 P.

However, abiotic and biotic stress limits bean yields to <600 kg ha−1 in low-income countries. Current low yields result in food insecurity, while demands for increased yields to match the rate of population growth combined with the threat of climate change are significant. Novel and significant advances in genetic improvement using untapped genetic diversity available in crop wild relatives and closely related species must be further explored. A meeting was organized by the Global Crop Diversity Trust to consider strategies for common bean improvement. This review resulted from that meeting and considers our current understanding of the genetic resources available for common bean improvement and the progress that has been achieved thus far through introgression of genetic diversity from wild relatives of common bean, and from closely related species, including: P. acutifolius, P. coccineus, P. costaricensis and P. dumosus. Newly developed genomic tools and their potential applications are presented. A broad outline of research for use of these genetic resources for common bean improvement in a ten-year multi-disciplinary effort is presented.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aPhaseolus acutifolius 3aPhaseolus coccineus 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aabiotic stress 3abeans 3abiotic stress 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3adeveloping countries 3afood security 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic resources 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3aintrogression 3apopulation growth 3awild relatives1 aBeaver, James S.eauthor1 aDebouck, Daniel G.eauthor1 aJackson, Scott A.eauthor1 aKelly, James D.eauthor1 aDempewolf, Hanneseauthor0 tAgronomy.g2013 May 10, v. 3, no. 2 p.433-461dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1236140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy30204333Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:12361b2073-4395c3d2e433  fAgronomy  aBatch:2296  aissued2 aMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing Instituteeprovider5DNAL  aIND6064688919ExL  a2019-09-06  a/data/metadata/incoming/mdpinstitute/agronomy-v03-i02-20130624.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/agronomy-v03-i02-20130624.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/mdpinstitute/  aUSDA/ARS  aBatch:2296 reviewed on 2019-09-06T13:00:05Z  aagid:6468891  a2019-06-14  a2019-09-0605096nab a2200649 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100014200171245010500313300001800418500002000436520232200456592002802778593001802806596007502824650001702899650001902916650002102935650001302956650002202969650001502991650001103006650002903017650000903046650002403055650001603079700010503095700016403200700009303364700014903457700011403606773013503720787003303855787001803888787002403906856007403930912001204004914004704016914003604063916001604099917001104115918004304126935002204169949001504191952001904206953005704225954006104282955003404343961002204377974001704399983001504416984001504431991594830730742620221117101756.0220505e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077637562DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.134892doi  aagid:7763756-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, SagareauthoruBioscience Division, Sandia National Laboratory, Livermore, California, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0828-163110aContinental United States may lose 1.8 petagrams of soil organic carbon under climate change by 2100  ap. 1147-1160.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: High‐resolution information on soils’ vulnerability to climate‐induced soil organic carbon (SOC) loss can enable environmental scientists, land managers, and policy makers to develop targeted mitigation strategies. This study aims to estimate baseline and decadal changes in continental US surface SOC stocks under future emission scenarios. LOCATION: Continental United States. TIME PERIOD: 2014–2100. METHODS: We used recent SOC field observations (n = 6,213 sites), environmental factors (n = 32), and an ensemble machine learning (ML) approach to estimate baseline SOC stocks in surface soils across the continental United States at 100‐m spatial resolution, and decadal changes under the projected climate scenarios of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Six (CMIP6) earth system models (ESMs). RESULTS: Baseline SOC projections from ML approaches captured more than 50% of variability in SOC observations, whereas ESMs represented only 6–16% of observed SOC variability. ML estimates showed a mean total loss of 1.8 Pg C from US surface soils under the high‐emission scenario by 2100, whereas ESMs showed no significant change in SOC stocks with wide variation among ESMs. Both ML and ESM predictions agree on the direction of SOC change (net emissions or sequestration) across 46–51% of continental US land area. These differences are attributable to the high‐resolution site‐specific data used in the ML models compared to the relatively coarse grid represented in CMIP6 ESMs. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our high‐resolution estimates of baseline SOC stocks, identification of key environmental controllers, and projection of SOC changes from US land cover types under future climate scenarios suggest the need for high‐resolution simulations of SOC in ESMs to represent the heterogeneity of SOC. We found that the SOC change is sensitive to key soil related factors (e.g. soil drainage and soil order) that have not been historically considered as input parameters in ESMs, because currently more than 95% variability in the SOC of CMIP6 ESMs is controlled by net primary productivity, temperature, and precipitation. Using additional environmental factors to estimate the baseline SOC stocks and predict the future trajectory of SOC change can provide more accurate results.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aDE‐AC02‐05CH11231cOffice of Biological and Environmental Research 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adrainage 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3amodels 3anet primary productivity 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3atemperature1 aMishra, UmakanteauthoruBioscience Division, Sandia National Laboratory, Livermore, California, USA1 aScown, Corinne D.eauthoruJoint BioEnergy Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Emeryville, California, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2078-11261 aWills, Skye A.eauthoruNational Soil Survey Center, USDA‐NRCS, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA1 aAdhikari, KabindraeauthoruGrassland, Soil and Water Research Laboratory, USDA‐ARS, Temple, Texas, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1365-70151 aDrewniak, Beth A.eauthoruEnvironmental Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois, USA0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2022 June, v. 31, no. 6 p.1147-1160dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl392018040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.134893Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl3920180b1466-822Xc31d6e1147  fGlobal ecology and biogeography  aBatch:10254  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6077637569ExL  a2022-05-06  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/1466822X_2022_31_6.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/1466822X_2022_31_6.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/ARSUSDA/NRCS  aagid:7763756  a2022-05-05  a2022-05-0504939nab a2200805 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003000121024003300151035002800184040001800212100013400230245014100364506007600505506003100581520179700612592002802409593001802437596000802455596000902463506003702472650001902509650001502528650001602543650002202559650001502581650001202596650001302608650001802621650001102639650001102650650001302661650002002674650001802694650002302712650001702735650001502752651001502767651001102782700010002793700012102893700010003014700005303114700006803167700010103235773008103336787003303417787001803450787002203468856011403490856007703604912001203681914002803693914002903721916001603750917001103766918002703777935002203804949001503826955003403841961000903875962003003884962004703914974001703961979003403978984001504012985010604027991594919730742620221207054234.0220901e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075446222DNAL7 a10113/75446222hdl7 a10.1029/2020wr0279242doi7 a10.1029/2020wr0279242chorus  aagid:7544622-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitlasten, WesleyeauthoruGNS Science  Taupo New Zealand, Nevada Water Science Center U.S. Geological Survey  Carson City NV USA10aIntegrated Hydrology and Operations Modeling to Evaluate Climate Change Impacts in an Agricultural Valley Irrigated With Snowmelt Runoff  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aApplying models to developed agricultural regions remains a difficult problem because there are no existing modeling codes that represent both the complex physics of the hydrology and anthropogenic manipulations to water distribution and consumption. We apply an integrated groundwater – surface water and hydrologic river operations model to an irrigated river valley in northwestern Nevada/northern California, United States to evaluate the impacts of climate change on snow-fed agricultural systems that use surface water and groundwater conjunctively. We explicitly represent individual surface water rights within the hydrologic model and allow the integrated code to change river diversions in response to earlier snowmelt runoff and water availability. Historically under-used supplemental groundwater rights are dynamically activated within the model to offset diminished surface water deliveries. The model accounts for feedbacks between the natural hydrology and anthropogenic stresses, which is a first-of-its-kind assessment of the impacts of climate change on individual water rights, and more broadly on river basin operations. Earlier snowmelt decreases annual surface water deliveries to all water rights, not just the junior water rights, owing to a lack of surface water storage in the upper river basin capable of capturing earlier runoff. Conversely, downstream irrigators with access to reservoir storage benefit from earlier runoff flowing past upstream points of diversion prior to the start of the irrigation season. Despite regional shifts toward greater reliance on groundwater for irrigation, crop consumption (a common surrogate for crop yield) decreases due to spatiotemporal changes in water supply that preferentially impact a subset of growers in the region.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNSF  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3airrigation 3aphysics 3aresearch 3ariver valleys 3arivers 3arunoff 3asnowmelt 3asurface storage 3asurface water 3awater distribution 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aCalifornia 3aNevada1 aMorway, Eric D.eauthoruNevada Water Science Center U.S. Geological Survey  Carson City NV USA1 aNiswonger, Richard G.eauthoruIntegrated Modeling and Prediction Division U.S. Geological Survey  Menlo Park CA USA1 aGardner, MurphyeauthoruNevada Water Science Center U.S. Geological Survey  Carson City NV USA1 aWhite, Jeremy T.eauthoruIntera  Boulder CO USA1 aTriana, EnriqueeauthoruRTI International  Fort Collins CO USA1 aSelkowitz, DavideauthoruNevada Water Science Center U.S. Geological Survey  Carson City NV USA0 tWater Resources Research.dAmerican Geophysical Union (AGU)x0043-13977nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4630640uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/75446223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020wr0279243Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46306c57d6  fWater Resources Research  aBatch:10228  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6075446229ExL  a2022-02-23  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1944-7973  aagid:7544622  aArticle missing volume number  a2022-09-06  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl04342nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002100115024003500136024001100171035002600182040001800208100003100226245017300257300001600430506017300446520152200619593001802141593002002159594002202179593002002201650004102221650001902262650002002281650002102301650002902322650001102351650002002362650001902382650002102401650001602422650002002438650001502458651000902473700002702482700003002509700002702539700002702566773012402593787003302717787001802750787002402768856011202792856008102904912001202985914004602997914003403043916001403077917001103091935002203102949001503124956010403139961000903243962003003252962004803282962004703330962004703377974001503424983001503439984001503454985011603469986001103585991595106710742620221214231755.0150227e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012113932DNAL7 a3128602aris7 a10113/604272hdl7 a10.1007/s10113-013-0573-92doi8 ans6662  aagid:60427-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaghefi, S.

Population growth and uncertainties due to climate change make historic data not a reliable source of information for future planning of water resources, hence necessitating climate and land use change impact studies. This work presents an integrated modeling approach by linking Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and MODSIM. While SWAT produces hydrologic and water resources information, MODSIM provides a decision support system for water allocation. We used the coupled SWAT-MODSIM to analyze the effects of climate and cropping pattern changes on agricultural and hydro energy production in the Karkheh River Basin, a semiarid region in south-west of Iran. Cropping patterns were considered by limiting the cereal production to 50% (S1, near to historic), 17% (S2), and 83% (S3) of the Canadian Global Coupled Model (CGCM 3.1 version (T63) for A1B, A2, and B1 scenarios. The results showed that based on future climate changes and land use scenarios, wheat production had a large variation in five economically important agricultural regions ranging from 33,000 ton year-1 (S2-A1B) to 74,000 ton pear-1 (S3-A2). Similarly, energy production, while increasing from 614 to 1,100 GWH in A2, decreased from 614 to 464 GWH in B1 climate scenario. Our analyses indicate that cropping pattern change can be used as an effective tool to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article  eARIS manuscript 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3acropping systems 3adecision support systems 3aenergy 3aland use change 3asemiarid zones 3awater allocation 3awater power 3awater resources 3awatersheds 3aIran1 aMousavi, S.

Peak numbers of 1st-stage larvae of both parasites were shed by Dall's sheep on their winter range from March until May. In larval development experiments in the Mackenzie Mountains, peak numbers of infective 3rd-stage larvae of P. odocoilei were available in gastropod intermediate hosts in August-September. For both protostrongylids, the majority of transmission likely occurs on the winter range, with infection of gastropods when they emerge from hibernation in spring, and infection of Dall's sheep upon their return in fall. We validated a degree-day model for temperature-dependent development of larval P. odocoilei in gastropods, and applied degree-day models to describe and predict spatial and temporal patterns in development of P. odocoilei and P. stilesi in northern North America. Temperature-dependent larval development may currently limit northward range expansion of P. odocoilei into naïve populations of Dall's sheep in the Arctic, but climate warming may soon eliminate such constraints. In Subarctic regions where both P. odocoilei and P. stilesi are endemic, the length of the parasite 'growing season' (when temperatures were above the threshold for larval development) and amount of warming available for parasite development has increased over the last 50 years. Further climate warming and extension of the seasonal window for transmission may lead to amplification of parasite populations and disease outbreaks in host populations.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3aDeroceras laeve 3aParelaphostrongylus 3aOvis dalli 3aslugs 3anematode infections 3alarval development 3adisease transmission 3amodel validation 3aanimal parasitic nematodes 3aglobal warming 3anematode larvae 3aheat sums 3aintermediate hosts 3aNorthwest Territories 0aepidemiology 0adegree-day models1 aVeitch, A.M.1 aKutz, S.J.1 aHoberg, E.P.1 aPolley, L.0 tParasitology.g2006 Mar., v.  132 p.387-401x0031-18207nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl45572  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/356193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820050091453Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl45572b0031-1820c132e387  fParasitology  aissued  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aIND437979709ExL  aINDdNZMe2006/04/25  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20091113 20091204 00000000bIND NZM 2006/04/25  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:35619  a2011-11-04  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a379797003112nab a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098035002800137040001800165100007900183245010300262300001600365520108700381592002801468593001801496650002701514650001901541650001501560650001201575650001201587650001501599650002401614650001301638650001201651653001901663653002201682653002201704653002401726653002101750700006801771773010901839787003301948787001801981787002201999856008502021912001202106914004402118914003602162916001402198917001102212918004302223935002202266949001502288953005402303961001202357962004702369962004702416974001702463983001502480984001502495991596513060742620221122205857.0150630e20150704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6028573872DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2015.10250792doi  aagid:2857387-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Franco, CarloseauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Washington, DC, USA10aUnderstanding Climate Change Perceptions, Attitudes, and Needs of Forest Service Resource Managers  ap. 423-444.  aSurveys were collected to assess Forest Service (FS) resource managers’ perceptions, attitudes, and informational needs related to climate change and its potential impacts on forests and grasslands. Resource managers with three background types were surveyed. All participants generally considered themselves to be well-informed on climate change issues, although each resource manager group had different perceptions of climate change effects on natural resources. They shared similar views on the most potentially useful sources of information and that there was less concern at the Ranger District level about climate change. Administrative issues, including funding, were viewed by all participants as serious obstacles inhibiting agency action. Results of these surveys should provide insight for increasing science delivery efforts, providing educational opportunities, and developing guidance and training for FS resource managers. As a result, the agency can continue to provide science-based tools which assist in conserving and maintaining healthy, resilient ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aattitudes and opinions 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aforests 3afunding 3agrasslands 3ainformation sources 3amanagers 3asurveys 0aclimate change 0aresource managers 0aforest management 0aForest Service (FS) 0ascience delivery1 aHaan, Tara J.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Washington, DC, USA0 tJournal of sustainable forestry.g2015 July 4, v. 34, no. 5 p.423-444dTaylor & Francisx1540-756X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4896740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2015.10250793Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl48967b1540-756Xc34d5e423  fJournal of sustainable forestry  aBatch:985  aissued2 aTaylor & Francis Groupeprovider5DNAL  aIND6028573879ExL  a2015-08-31  awjsf20_wjsf20.v034.i05_20150626021107#6548784.zip  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:985 reviewed on 2015-08-19T18:00:02Z  aBatch:985 reviewed on 2015-08-31T11:00:03Z  aagid:2857387  a2015-06-30  a2015-08-3105595nab a2200901 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002800133040001800161100017100179245016700350300001200517520139800529592002801927593001801955596005401973650001002027650001802037650001202055650002602067650001402093650001202107650001902119650002402138650002902162650002202191650002202213650002102235650001102256650001302267650002202280650002002302650001702322650001802339650001202357650001102369650001002380650001502390651003102405700006602436700008302502700011002585700012802695700012202823700006002945700012903005700009603134700008103230700010703311700008503418700012903503700012703632700009903759700009003858773014003948787003304088787001804121787002104139856008204160912001204242914004404254914003504298916001504333917001104348918002904359935002204388949001504410953006704425954005704492955003704549961001204586962004804598974001704646983001504663984001504678991596561860742620221120063834.0190529e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063887862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-019-4145-62doi  aagid:6388786-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelyazid, SalimeauthoruDepartment of Physical Geography, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden. salim.belyazid@natgeo.su.se1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7893-485610aAssessing the Effects of Climate Change and Air Pollution on Soil Properties and Plant Diversity in Northeastern U.S. Hardwood Forests: Model Setup and Evaluation  ap. 106.  aThe integrated forest ecosystem model ForSAFE-Veg was used to simulate soil processes and understory vegetation composition at three—sugar maple, beech, yellow birch—hardwood forest sites in the Northeastern United States (one at Hubbard Brook, NH, and two at Bear Brook, ME). Input data were pooled from a variety of sources and proved coherent and consistent. While the biogeochemical component ForSAFE was used with limited calibration, the ground vegetation composition module Veg was calibrated to field relevés. Evaluating different simulated ecosystem indicators (soil solution chemistry, tree biomass, ground vegetation composition) showed that the model performed comparably well regardless of the site’s soil condition, climate, and amounts of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) deposition, with the exception of failing to capture tree biomass decline at Hubbard Brook. The model performed better when compared with annual observation than monthly data. The results support the assumption that the biogeochemical model ForSAFE can be used with limited calibration and provide reasonable confidence, while the vegetation community composition module Veg requires calibration if the individual plant species are of interest. The study welcomes recent advances in empirically explaining the responses of hardwood forests to nutrient imbalances and points to the need for more research.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aEP-C-11-036cU.S. Environmental Protection Agency 3aFagus 3aair pollution 3abiomass 3abotanical composition 3achemistry 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental indicators 3aforest ecosystems 3aground vegetation 3ahardwood forests 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aplant communities 3asoil properties 3asoil quality 3asoil solution 3astreams 3asulfur 3atrees 3aunderstory 3aNortheastern United States1 aPhelan, JennifereauthoruRTI International, Raleigh, NC, USA1 aNihlgård, BengteauthoruDepartment of Biology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden1 aSverdrup, HaraldeauthoruDepartment of Industrial Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland1 aDriscoll, CharleseauthoruDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA1 aFernandez, IvaneauthoruSchool of Forest Resources and Climate Change Institute, University of Maine, Orono, ME, USA1 aAherne, JulianeauthoruTrent University, Trent, Canada1 aTeeling-Adams, Leslie M.eauthoruDepartment of Life and Physical Sciences, Great Bay Community College, Portsmouth, NH, USA1 aBailey, ScotteauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northeastern Research Station, Campton, NH, USA1 aArsenault, MatteauthoruStantec Consulting Services, Inc., Topsham, ME, USA1 aCleavitt, NatalieeauthoruDepartment of Natural Resources, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA1 aEngstrom, BretteauthoruCounsulting Botanist and Ecologist, Marshfield, VT, USA1 aDennis, RobineauthoruNational Exposure Research Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Triangle Park, NC, 27711, USA1 aSperduto, DaneauthoruUSDA Forest Service, White Mountain National Forest, 71 White Mountain Dr., Campton, NH, 03223, USA1 aWerier, DavideauthoruDavid Werier Botanical and Ecological Consulting, Willseyville, NY, USA1 aClark, ChristophereauthoruU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC, USA0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2019 May, v. 230, no. 5 p.106-106dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl487640uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-019-4145-63Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4876b0049-6979c230d5e106  fWater, air, and soil pollution  aBatch:2228  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6063887869ExL  a2019-06-13  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_19-05-29_06-47-25.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/11270-230-5.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:2228 reviewed on 2019-06-13T04:00:03Z  aagid:6388786  a2019-05-29  a2019-06-1303995nab a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004100097035002700138040001800165100012600183245011600309300001600425520183000441592002802271593001802299650001202317650001902329650001502348650002202363650001102385650001902396650001602415650001702431650001502448651001102463700015302474700020802627773009902835787003302934787001802967787001802985856008703003912001203090914004003102914003203142917001103174918003403185935002103219949001503240953003303255961001203288962004803300962004703348974001603395983001503411984001503426991596957310742620221120024822.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447546622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.09.0112doi  aagid:442965-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarley, Kathleen A.eauthoruDepartment of Geography, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182-4493, United States10aVulnerability of water supply from the Oregon Cascades to changing climate: Linking science to users and policy  ap. 110-122.  aDespite improvements in understanding biophysical response to climate change, a better understanding of how such changes will affect societies is still needed. We evaluated effects of climate change on the coupled humanâenvironmental system of the McKenzie River watershed in the Oregon Cascades in order to assess its vulnerability. Published empirical and modeling results indicate that climate change will alter both the timing and quantity of streamflow, but understanding how these changes will impact different water users is essential to facilitate adaptation to changing conditions. In order to better understand the vulnerability of four water use sectors to changing streamflow, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with representatives of each sector, in which we presented projected changes in streamflow and asked respondents to assess how changing water availability would impact their activities. In the McKenzie River watershed, there are distinct spatial and temporal patterns associated with sensitivity of water resources to climate change. This research illustrates that the implications of changing streamflow vary substantially among different water users, with vulnerabilities being determined in part by the spatial scale and timing of water use and the flexibility of those uses in time and space. Furthermore, institutions within some sectors were found to be better positioned to effectively respond to changes in water resources associated with climate change, while others have substantial barriers to the flexibility needed to manage for new conditions. A clearer understanding of these opportunities and constraints across water use sectors can provide a basis for improving response capacity and potentially reducing vulnerability to changing water resources in the region.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3arivers 3aspace and time 3astream flow 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aOregon1 aTague, ChristinaeauthoruBren School of Environmental Science and Management, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-5131, United States1 aGrant, Gordon E.eauthoruUS Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, USDA, Corvallis, OR 97331, United States; Department of Geosciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, United States0 tGlobal environmental change.g2011 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.110-122dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)206340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:2063b0959-3780c21d1e110  fGlobal environmental change  aissued2 aElsevier B.V.eprovider5DNAL  aIND447546629ExL  a2014-01-08  aNAL271500959378000210001.xml  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:408 annotated on 2013-12-17T13:09:46Z  aBatch:408 reviewed on 2014-01-08T16:00:03Z  aagid:442965  a2014-11-11  a2014-11-1105753nab a2200877 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002300115024003700138024001200175035002800187040001800215100012200233245011700355300001400472506017300486520207100659592002802730593001802758594002202776593002002798650001202818650001902830650000902849650001502858650001302873650001202886650002302898650001602921650001902937650002402956650001102980650000902991650002003000650002603020650001603046650001703062651000903079653001203088653001803100653001503118653002303133653002003156700010703176700013703283700010703420700012203527700014003649700013803789773012903927787003304056787001804089787002104107856008404128856011404212912001204326914003104338914003404369916001504403917001104418918003604429935002204465949001504487953007004502954007104572955004504643956008504688961001304773962003004786974001704816983001504833984001504848986001204863991596989770742620221214225028.0190403e20170731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056848622DNAL7 a3321222aris7 a10113/56848622hdl7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2017.04.0192doi8 ans13057  aagid:5684862-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaule, WilliameauthoruGreat Lakes Integrated Sciences+Assessments, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA10aNorthwest Ohio crop yield benefits of water capture and subirrigation based on future climate change projections  ap. 87-97.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aClimate change projections for the Midwest U.S. indicate a future with increased growing season dryness that will adversely impact crop production sustainability. Systems that capture water for later subirrigation use have potential as a climate adaptation strategy to mitigate this increased crop water stress. Three such systems were operated in northwest Ohio from 1996 to 2008, and they exhibited substantial crop yield benefits, especially in dry growing seasons, but also to a lesser extent in near normal or wet growing seasons. The goal of this research was to estimate the increase in crop yield benefits of water capture and subirrigation systems that can be expected under projcted 2041–2070 climate conditions in northwest Ohio. Historical subirrigated field crop yield differences with fields having free drainage only, relative to growing season dryness/wetness, were used to determine future northwest Ohio subirrigated field crop yield increases, based on the modeled climate for 2041–2070. Climate records for 2041–2070 were projected using three bias corrected model combinations, CRCM+CGCM3, RCM3+GFDL, and MM5I+HadCM3. Growing season dryness/wetness was classified based on the difference between rainfall and the crop adjusted potential evapotranspiration using the 1984–2013 climate record at the three system locations. Projected 2041–2070 growing season precipitation varied substantially between the three model combinations; however, all three indicated increased growing season dryness due to rising temperature and solar radiation. The overall subirrigated field corn yield increase rose to an estimated 27.5%–30.0% in 2041–2070 from 20.5% in 1996–2008, while the subirrigated field soybean yield increase improved from 12.2% in 1996–2008 to 19.8%–21.5% for 2041–2070. Consequently, as growing season drought becomes more frequent, the crop yield benefits with water capture and subirrigation systems will improve, and these systems therefore provide a viable climate adaptation strategy for agricultural production.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article  eARIS manuscript 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop yield 3adrainage 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3afield crops 3agrowing season 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3arain 3asolar radiation 3asubsurface irrigation 3atemperature 3awater stress 3aOhio 0aClimate 0aSubirrigation 0aCrop-Yield 0aEvapotranspiration 0aWater–Capture1 aAllred, BarryeauthoruUSDA-ARS Soil Drainage Unit, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA1 aFrankenberger, JaneeauthoruDepartment of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA1 aGamble, DebraeauthoruUSDA-ARS Soil Drainage Unit, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA1 aAndresen, JeffeauthoruGreat Lakes Integrated Sciences+Assessments, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA1 aGunn, Kpoti M.eauthoruDepartment of Food, Agricultural and Biological Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA1 aBrown, LarryeauthoruDepartment of Food, Agricultural and Biological Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 July 31, v. 189 p.87-97dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.04.0193Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/56848623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:1719  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6056848629ExL  a2019-04-03  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00067-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S0378377417301610.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/332122.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aagid:5684862  a2019-04-03  a2019-04-03  ans1305705644nab a2200829 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003400098035002800132040001800160100017000178245010100348300001600449520225400465592002802719593001802747650002602765650001102791650002502802650001902827650002502846650001902871650001902890650002302909650001502932650002902947650001002976650001502986650001503001650002503016650001603041650001803057650002003075650002603095650001503121650002003136650002103156650001703177650001203194653002503206653002403231653003003255653002003285653001903305653001903324700014303343700015503486700012903641700014703770700013503917773015604052787003304208787001804241787002204259856008104281912001204362914004404374914003504418916001504453917001104468918003604479935002204515949001504537953007004552954007104622955004504693961002904738974001704767983001504784984001504799991597060530742620221120215635.0190412e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013002722DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-12-00142.12doi  aagid:1300272-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoyce, Linda A.eauthoruQuantitative Ecologist, Human Dimensions Research Program, USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fort Collins, CO 80526, USA;10aClimate Change and North American Rangelands: Assessment of Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies  ap. 512-528.  aRecent climatic trends and climate model projections indicate that climate change will modify rangeland ecosystem functions and the services and livelihoods that they provision. Recent history has demonstrated that climatic variability has a strong influence on both ecological and social components of rangeland systems and that these systems possess substantial capacity to adapt to climatic variability. Specific objectives of this synthesis are to: 1) evaluate options to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and future climate change; 2) survey actions that individuals, enterprises, and social organizations can use to adapt to climate change; and 3) assess options for system transformation when adaptation is no longer sufficient to contend with climate change. Mitigation for carbon sequestration does not appear economically viable, given the small and highly variable carbon dioxide fluxes of rangeland ecosystems and the high transaction costs that would be incurred. In contrast, adaptation strategies are numerous and provide a means to manage risks associated with climate change. Adaptation strategies are diverse, including altered risk perception by individuals, greater flexibility of production enterprises, and modifications to social organizations that emphasize climatic variability, rather than consistency. Many adaptations represent “no regrets” actions because their implementation can be justified without emphasis on pending climate change. Adaptations specific to livestock production systems can include flexible herd management, alternative livestock breeds or species, innovative pest management, modified enterprise structures, and geographic relocation. Social-ecological systems in which adaptation is insufficient to counter the adverse consequences of climate change might undergo transformative change to produce alternative ecosystem services, production enterprises, and livelihoods. The rangeland profession is in a pivotal position to provide leadership on this global challenge because it represents the intersection of management and scientific knowledge, includes diverse stakeholders who derive their livelihoods from rangelands, and interacts with organizations responsible for rangeland stewardship.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aalternative livestock 3abreeds 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aherds 3aleadership 3alivelihood 3alivestock production 3aoccupations 3aorganizations 3apest management 3aproduction technology 3arangelands 3arisk perception 3asocial structure 3astakeholders 3asurveys 0acarbon sequestration 0aland change science 0asocial-ecological systems 0asocial learning 0asustainability 0atransformation1 aBriske, David D.eauthoruProfessor, Department of Ecosystem Science and Management, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA;1 aBrown, Joel R.eauthoruRangeland Management Specialist, USDA-NRCS Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM 88003, USA;1 aPolley, H.

Increased biospheric warming is also projected to modify the amount and distribution of annual precipitation and increase the occurrence of both drought and heat waves. The ecological consequences of climate change will vary substantially among ecoregions because of regional differences in antecedent environmental conditions; the rate and magnitude of change in the primary climate change drivers, including elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), warming and precipitation modification; and nonadditive effects among climate drivers. Elevated atmospheric CO2 will directly stimulate plant growth and reduce negative effects of drying in a warmer climate by increasing plant water use efficiency; however, the CO2 effect is mediated by environmental conditions, especially soil water availability. Warming and drying are anticipated to reduce soil water availability, net primary productivity, and other ecosystem processes in the southern Great Plains, the Southwest, and northern Mexico, but warmer and generally wetter conditions will likely enhance these processes in the northern Plains and southern Canada. The Northwest will warm considerably, but annual precipitation is projected to change little despite a large decrease in summer precipitation. Reduced winter snowpack and earlier snowmelt will affect hydrology and riparian systems in the Northwest. Specific consequences of climate change will be numerous and varied and include modifications to forage quantity and quality and livestock production systems, soil C content, fire regimes, livestock metabolism, and plant community composition and species distributions, including range contraction and expansion of invasive species. Recent trends and model projections indicate continued directional change and increasing variability in climate that will substantially affect the provision of ecosystem services on North American rangelands.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abiogeography 3abiosphere 3abotanical composition 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3adrying 3aecoregions 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afire regime 3agreenhouse effect 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat 3aindustrialization 3ainvasive species 3alivestock 3alivestock production 3ametabolism 3aplant available water 3aplant growth 3aprimary productivity 3aproduction technology 3arangelands 3asnowmelt 3asnowpack 3asummer 3awater use efficiency 3aCanada 3aMexico 0aatmospheric CO2 0aatmospheric warming 0aclimate variability 0agreenhouse gases 0alivestock production 0aprecipitation patterns1 aBriske, David D.eauthoruProfessor, Department of Ecosystem Science and Management, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA1 aMorgan, Jack A.eauthoruPlant Physiologist, USDA-ARS Crops Research Laboratory, Fort Collins, CO 80526, USA1 aWolter, KlauseauthoruResearch Associate, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Earth Systems Research Laboratory, Boulder, CO 80305, USA1 aBailey, Derek W.eauthoruProfessor, Animal and Range Sciences Department, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM 88003, USA1 aBrown, Joel R.eauthoruRangeland Management Specialist, USDA-NRCS Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM 88003, USA.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2013 Sept., v. 66, no. 5 p.493-511dElsevier Inc.aThe Society for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl4456940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2111/REM-D-12-00068.13Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl44569b1551-5028c66d5e493  fRangeland ecology & management  aBatch:1152  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6013002689ExL  a2019-04-12  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00102-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S1550742413500595.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aUSDA/NRCSUSDA/ARS  aagid:1300268  a2019-04-12  a2019-04-1203566nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002100097024001900118024005600137035002600193040001800219100013300237245005700370300001800427500002000445500001500465520095800480592002801438593001801466593002001484650002801504650002001532650001001552650001901562650001501581650001501596650001901611650001501630650001201645650001001657650001401667650002701681650002201708650002301730650002401753650001001777651002601787653002501813700003001838700010901868700003301977700011502010773009802125787001802223787003302241787003002274787002202304852000902326856011202335856010602447912001202553914004502565914001202610917001102622918004302633935002102676949001502697953002702712961001202739974001502751983001502766984001502781986001202796991597284600742620221121055036.0170626e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438643422DNAL7 a10113/283432hdl7 a169223122pmid7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1611:PEAARO]2.0.CO;22doi  aagid:28343-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwartz, Mark W.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, Davis, California 95616 USA10aPredicting extinctions as a result of climate change  ap. 1611-1615.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-05  aWidespread extinction is a predicted ecological consequence of global warming. Extinction risk under climate change scenarios is a function of distribution breadth. Focusing on trees and birds of the eastern United States, we used joint climate and environment models to examine fit and climate change vulnerability as a function of distribution breadth. We found that extinction vulnerability increases with decreasing distribution size. We also found that model fit decreases with decreasing distribution size, resulting in high prediction uncertainty among narrowly distributed species. High prediction uncertainty creates a conservation dilemma in that excluding these species under‐predicts extinction risk and favors mistaken inaction on global warming. By contrast, including narrow endemics results in over‐predicting extinction risk and promotes mistaken inaction on behalf of individual species prematurely considered doomed to extinction.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3apopulation distribution 3arisk assessment 3atrees 3aglobal warming 3aextinction 3awild birds 3aclimate models 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aBirds 2aEcosystem 2aExtinction, Biological 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aTrees 3aEastern United States 0aenvironmental models1 aIverson, Louis R.eauthor1 aPrasad, Anantha M.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Northeastern Research Station, Delaware, Ohio 43015 USA1 aMatthews, Stephen N.eauthor1 aO'Connor, Raymond J.eauthoruDepartment of Wildlife Ecology, University of Maine, Orono, Maine 04469-5755 USA0 tEcology.g2006 July, v. 87, no. 7 p.1611-1615dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl46164  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/283433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87%5B1611:PEAARO%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl46164b0012-9658c87d7e1611  fEcology  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND438643429ExL  a2014-07-17  a00129658_2006_87_7.xml  aUSDA/FS  aagid:28343  a2017-06-26  a2017-06-26  a386434204520nab a2200805 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098035002800137040001800165100012300183245014500306300001600451520117900467592002801646593001801674650001201692650002901704650001301733650001901746650001501765650001001780650001301790650001001803650002101813650001101834650001401845650001501859650001901874650001601893650002601909650001401935650000901949653001601958653001701974653001901991653002302010653002102033653001702054653001302071700013702084700013502221700012602356700010002482700012402582700010202706700009502808700013302903773012303036787003303159787001803192787002003210856008603230912001203316914004003328914003203368916001503400917001103415918003603426935002203462949001503484953006003499954006103559955003503620961001203655974001703667983001503684984001503699991597363360742620221120063727.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056601862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.03.0082doi  aagid:5660186-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoyle, David R.eauthoruD.B.

Soil fauna, while widely acknowledged to be important drivers of biogeochemical function, soil structure and sustainability, and trophic interactions, are understudied compared to other belowground organisms such as archaea, bacteria, and fungi. In this review we summarize the current state of knowledge of soil fauna as it relates to and is influenced by various disturbances. We focus our review on three main natural and anthropogenic disturbance types: 1) natural disturbances, including damage from wind and flooding; 2) invasive species, including above and belowground flora and fauna; and 3) climate change impacts on the atmosphere and temperature. We do not address the impacts of wildfires, forestry, agricultural practices, mining, or human-caused pollution, as these topics have all been covered in other works. We highlight knowledge gaps and suggest future avenues of research, with hope that the importance of soil fauna and their influences on ecosystems will be given greater emphasis in future research.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aArchaea 3aanthropogenic activities 3abacteria 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aflora 3aforestry 3afungi 3ainvasive species 3amining 3apollution 3asoil fauna 3asoil structure 3atemperature 3atrophic relationships 3awildfires 3awind 0aBelowground 0aBiodiversity 0aClimate change 0aEcosystem function 0aInvasive species 0aInvertebrate 0aTaxonomy1 aNagendra, Uma J.eauthoruDepartment of Plant Biology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-94021 aTaylor, Melanie K.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Center for Forest Disturbance Science, Athens, GA, USA1 aCampbell, J.

The objective of this study was to identify maize (Zea mays L.) cultivar parameters that maintain yield under projected climate for late in the 21st century under full and deficit irrigation in a semi-arid region. The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) was calibrated with four years of maize data from northeastern Colorado, USA, under various irrigation conditions and was then used to simulate climate change effects on maize production with current management practices. Results showed that projected climate change decreased yield by 21% and biomass by 7% late in the 21st century (2070–2091) under full irrigation, compared to yield in the current climate (1992–2013). Under deficit irrigation, the corresponding reductions were 14% and 3%, respectively. Using the cultivar parameters calibrated with RZWQM2 for southern Colorado condition did not show yield decrease under future climate, but it simulated much lower yield under current climate in northeastern Colorado. A cultivar from the DSSAT (Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer) crop database (GL 482) produced similar yield to experimental data under current climate and increased yield by 4% at full irrigation under future climate in northeastern Colorado. Using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), we also identified 70 cultivars with longer maturity duration (between silking and physiological maturity) and higher grain filling rate for mitigating climate change effects on maize production. These two identified traits can guide plant breeders in developing cultivars for the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  eARIS manuscript 3aRoot Zone Water Quality Model 3aZea mays 3aair temperature 3abiomass production 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop production 3acultivars 3adatabases 3adecision support systems 3adeficit irrigation 3afilling period 3airrigation rates 3asemiarid zones 3aColorado 0aAET 0aDSSAT 0aET 0aETc 0aETr 0aGLEAMS 0aIPCC 0aLHS 0aRCP 0aRZWQM 0aSHAW 0aTDR 0aWUE 0aSystems modeling 0aRZWQM 0aDSSAT 0aCultivar traits 0aClimate adaptation 0aCrop simulation 0aIrrigation management 0aColorado1 aAhuja, L.R.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Agricultural Systems Research Unit, Fort Collins, CO 80526, United States1 aIslam, A.eauthoruDivision of Natural Resources Management (NRM), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi, 110012, India1 aTrout, T.J.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Water Management and Systems Research Unit, Fort Collins, CO 80526, United States1 aSaseendran, S.A.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Crop Production Systems Research Unit, Stoneville, MS 38776, United States1 aMalone, R.W.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, The National Lab for Agricultural and The Environment, Ames, IA 50011, United States0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 Jan. 31, v. 180 p.88-98dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl846040uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.11.0073Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/55855983Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8460b0378-3774c180e88  fAgricultural water management  aBatch:1481  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6055855989ExL  a2019-08-22  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn-backfiles/46-2-00066-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/S0378377416304504.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn-backfiles/  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/nal%20320719%20Malone%20modeling%20yeild%20and%20biomass%202016.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aagid:5585598  a2019-04-03  a2019-08-22  ans1759404247nab a2200685 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003600098035002800134040001800162100017600180245010400356300001300460520139300473592002801866593001801894596006201912596004601974650001202020650001702032650001902049650002102068650001602089650001502105650001402120650000802134650001902142650001102161650001702172650001102189650001502200651001102215700011502226700012402341700009102465700008702556700013602643700013002779773011102909787003303020787001803053787002103071856008303092912001203175914004203187914002003229916001503249917001103264918002903275935002203304949001503326953006703341954005703408955003703465961001203502974001703514983001503531984001503546991599135340742620221122211315.0210119e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071455312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-020-02748-92doi  aagid:7145531-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Dana R.

We used regression and correlation analyses to examine the relationships among subarctic riverbank erosion and seasonal hydrology, the impact of climate change and variability, and the societal implications. Geomorphic change (loss and gain of vegetated land) was mapped along several river reaches in the Yukon River Basin, Alaska, throughout 1984 and 2017 using Landsat satellite imagery. Annual erosion rates were estimated from these spatial data. At most study sites, erosion rates (km²/year) were either positively correlated (r = 0.68–0.84, p = 0.0085–0.061) with monthly mean discharge within the cold season or inversely correlated (r = − 0.74 – −0.62, p < 0.10) with river ice breakup date in the spring. These proximate controls on erosion, in turn, were influenced both by climate variability and long-term climatic change. We conclude that increased cold season discharge and earlier freshet that occurs under warmer conditions enhance riverbank erosion in most areas. Climate-related changes to fluvial dynamics may impact communities through effects on infrastructure, travel safety, channel navigability, fish and wildlife habitat, and access to subsistence resources.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aNNX15AT72AcNational Aeronautics and Space Administration  a1518563cNational Science Foundation (US) 3aLandsat 3abank erosion 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acold season 3acold zones 3ahydrology 3aice 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3aspatial data 3aspring 3awatersheds 3aAlaska1 aBrinkman, Todd J.eauthoruInstitute of Arctic Biology, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, Alaska, USA1 aBolton, W.

The Southwest (SW) region encompasses six states which provide highly diverse agricultural crops including cotton, stone fruit and grapes. Here we report on the establishment of programs to assist SW working landowners with the impacts of climate change, with focus on the water resources of the region. Water is a critical component of agricultural vulnerability in the SW, where high agricultural production can occur with sufficient irrigation. Since 1978, crop yield declines were reported on 11-21% of total irrigated acres, mostly due to surface water shortage. Southwestern agriculture relies heavily on groundwater, using it to supply more than one-third of the agricultural water demand since 1955. Regional groundwater use varies over time, with a decline in the agricultural groundwater fraction in Arizona, but an increase in the fraction in Nevada and Utah. Observed and predicted changes in the southwestern hydrologic cycle can impact regional agriculture. Observed records show an increase in the fraction of precipitation falling as rain, which is expected to continue with future warming. Warming causes the snowmelt to peak earlier in the season and can reduce water available to crops during the summer months without additional water storage. Observed records indicate streamflow has shifted earlier in the year, most notably in snow dominated watersheds a continuation of this trend may challenge regional agriculture by further limiting water supply.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission  aEmbargoed article  bmartinezcc2017-07-23dcmartineze2017-07-23  eARIS manuscript 3aUSDA 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acotton 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aeducation 3aforesters 3agrapes 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic cycle 3airrigation 3alandowners 3arain 3aranchers 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3astone fruits 3astream flow 3asummer 3asurface water 3awater shortages 3awatersheds 3aArizona 3aNevada 3aUtah1 aRango, Alberteauthor1 aSmith, Ryanneauthor1 aMaxwell, Connie J.eauthor1 aSteele, Catriana M.eauthor1 aHavstad, Kris M.eauthor0 tJournal of contemporary water research and education.g2016 Aug. 1, v. 158 p.46-61wJournal:21516x1936-704X7nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2151640uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/56954633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1936-704X.2016.03218.x  aArticle  aJournal:21516c158e46  fJournal of contemporary water research and education  aBatch:1795  aissued  aIND6056954639ExL  a2021-06-22  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/16-017.pdf  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aBatch:1795 reviewed on 2017-08-07T14:00:03Z  aagid:5695463  a2017-05-16  a2020-09-10  aUSDA submission converted from Drupal to MODS version 3.4 using submission2mods.xsl (Revision 1.002 2014/01/28)  ans1242204542nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024001700121024003100138035002800169040001800197100002600215245016900241300001600410506017300426520176700599593001802366594002202384593002002406650004102426650001302467650001202480650001902492650002502511650000902536650001502545650001402560650003502574650001302609650001502622650000902637650001702646650000902663650001102672650001902683650000902702650002202711650001702733650001602750650001502766650001502781651000902796700002502805700002902830773012402859787003302983787001803016787001803034856011403052856004403166912001203210914002903222914004303251916001503294917001103309935002203320949001503342956012903357961000903486962003003495962004803525974001703573983001503590984001503605985011603620986001203736991599402360742620221214223453.0161201e20120125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056953502DNAL7 a10113/56953502hdl7 a2776702aris7 a10.2489/jswc.67.5.3432doi  aagid:5695350-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDabney, S.

Extensive databases describing climate, soils, and management options have been developed and are widely used in the USA for conservation planning. The increasing availability of high resolution topographic information creates opportunities for Geographical Information System tools to automatically delineate the location of concentrated flow areas where RUSLE2 hillslope profiles end. Recent RUSLE2 enhancements to allow estimation of erosion and runoff from a representative sequence of runoff events that are suitable for linkage with an ephemeral gully model. This paper reviews the sensitivity of RUSLE2 erosion estimates to possible climate change scenarios, demonstrates its ability to evaluate alternative management adaptations, and compares predictions with observations of runoff and sediment yield from the a 6.6 ha (16 acre) research watershed located near Treynor, IA. When applied to a representative hillslope profile farmed with conventional-tillage corn, increasing monthly temperature by 0.8 °C (1.5 °F) and rainfall depth, rainfall erosivity density, and 10-year, 24-hour rainfall depth each by 10% cumulatively increased sheet and rill erosion by 47%, increased runoff by 33%, assuming there was no change in corn yield. If the climate changes decreased corn yield by 10%, the overall effect was to increase soil loss for conservation planning by 63%. These results demonstrate that modest and expected changes in climate will significantly increase the risk of soil erosion and improved conservation management will be an important part of successful adaptation.  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article  eARIS manuscript 3aRevised Universal Soil Loss Equation 3aZea mays 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3acrop yield 3adatabases 3ageographic information systems 3aplanning 3aprediction 3arain 3arill erosion 3arisk 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asoil 3asoil conservation 3aspatial data 3atemperature 3atopography 3awatersheds 3aIowa1 aYoder, D.

Crop contamination with these dangerous toxins transcends health, food security, and trade sectors. It cuts across the value chain, affecting farmers, traders, markets, and finally consumers. Diverse fungi within Aspergillus section Flavi contaminate crops with aflatoxins. Within these Aspergillus communities, several genotypes are not capable of producing aflatoxins (atoxigenic). Carefully selected atoxigenic genotypes in biological control (biocontrol) formulations efficiently reduce aflatoxin contamination of crops when applied prior to flowering in the field. This safe and environmentally friendly, effective technology was pioneered in the US, where well over a million acres of susceptible crops are treated annually. The technology has been improved for use in sub-Saharan Africa, where efforts are under way to develop biocontrol products, under the trade name Aflasafe, for 11 African nations. The number of participating nations is expected to increase. In parallel, state of the art technology has been developed for large-scale inexpensive manufacture of Aflasafe products under the conditions present in many African nations. Results to date indicate that all Aflasafe products, registered and under experimental use, reduce aflatoxin concentrations in treated crops by >80% in comparison to untreated crops in both field and storage conditions. Benefits of aflatoxin biocontrol technologies are discussed along with potential challenges, including climate change, likely to be faced during the scaling-up of Aflasafe products. Lastly, we respond to several apprehensions expressed in the literature about the use of atoxigenic genotypes in biocontrol formulations. These responses relate to the following apprehensions: sorghum as carrier, distribution costs, aflatoxin-conscious markets, efficacy during drought, post-harvest benefits, risk of allergies and/or aspergillosis, influence of Aflasafe on other mycotoxins and on soil microenvironment, dynamics of Aspergillus genotypes, and recombination between atoxigenic and toxigenic genotypes in natural conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aatoxigenic 0amaize 0agroundnut 0aAflasafe 0acommercialisation1 aOrtega-Beltran, A.eauthoruInternational Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), PMB 5320, Oyo Road, 200001 Ibadan, Nigeria1 aAkande, A.eauthoruIITA, PMB 82, Garki GPO, Kubwa, Abuja, Nigeria1 aMutegi, C.eauthoruIITA, ILRI campus, P.O.

Rising global temperatures, disrupted precipitation patterns and increased CO₂ levels that are associated with future climate conditions are expected to impact the growth and toxigenic potential of A. flavus. Both laboratory and real world observations have demonstrated this potential, especially when examining the effects of water availability and temperature. Recent experiments have also established that CO₂ may also be affecting toxin production. The application of current technologies in the field of functional genomics, including genomic sequencing, RNA-seq, microarray technologies and proteomics have revealed climate change-related, abiotic regulation of the aflatoxin cluster and influence on the plant-fungus interaction. Furthermore, elevated CO₂ levels have been shown to impact expression of the aflatoxin biosynthetic regulatory gene aflR. The use of functional genomics will allow researchers to better understand the underlying transcriptomic response within the fungus to climate change, with a view towards predicting changes in fungal infection and toxin production associated with climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 0amycotoxins 0awater activity 0atemperature 0acarbon dioxide 0atranscriptomics1 aMack, B.M.eauthoruFood and Feed Safety Research Unit, Agricultural Research Service, USDA, New Orleans, LA 70124-4305, USA1 aPayne, G.A.eauthoruDepartment of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695-7567, USA1 aBhatnagar, D.eauthoruFood and Feed Safety Research Unit, Agricultural Research Service, USDA, New Orleans, LA 70124-4305, USA0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2016 Nov. 2, v. 9, no. 5 p.665-672dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 o(Journal)jnl439572440uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2016.20493Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4395724b1875-0796c9d5e665  fWorld mycotoxin journal  areview2 aWageningen Academic Publisherseprovider5DNAL  aIND6068170349ExL  a/data/metadata/incoming/wagen/WMJv9i5-02250342-125115.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wagen/wmj2016.2049.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wagen/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:6817034  a2020-02-26  a2020-02-2604065nab a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004200097024002100139035002600160040001800186100001900204245005900223300001600282500002400298500001500322520167600337593001802013593002002031650002402051650002702075650001402102650002002116650002602136650001102162650001902173650002302192650002102215650002202236650001502258650002102273650001502294651001202309651001802321651001102339653001802350653002102368653002302389700002102412700002002433700001702453700001802470700001902488773008102507787001802588787003302606787003002639787002202669852000902691856009202700856011202792912001202904914004302916914002202959917001102981930003302992935002103025945001303046946001103059949001503070952004103085961001203126974001503138984001503153985010303168986001203271991599468580742620221117183610.0021126e200209  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232985162DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2486.2002.00516.x2doi7 a10113/172192hdl  aagid:17219-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehfeldt, G.E.10aIntraspecific responses to climate in Pinus sylvestris  ap. 912-929.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aFive population-specific response functions were developed from quadratic models for 110 populations of Pinus sylvestris growing at 47 planting sites in Eurasia and North America. The functions predict 13 year height from climate: degree-days > 5 °C; mean annual temperature; degree-days < 0 °C; summer-winter temperature differential; and a moisture index, the ratio of degree-days > 5 °C to mean annual precipitation. Validation of the response functions with two sets of independent data produced for all functions statistically significant simple correlations with coefficients as high as 0.81 between actual and predicted heights. The response functions described the widely different growth potentials typical of natural populations and demonstrated that these growth potentials have different climatic optima. Populations nonetheless tend to inhabit climates colder than their optima, with the disparity between the optimal and inhabited climates becoming greater as the climate becomes more severe. When driven by a global warming scenario of the Hadley Center, the functions described short-term physiologic and long-term evolutionary effects that were geographically complex. The short-term effects should be negative in the warmest climates but strongly positive in the coldest. Long-term effects eventually should ameliorate the negative short-term impacts, enhance the positive, and in time, substantially increase productivity throughout most of the contemporary pine forests of Eurasia. Realizing the long-term gains will require redistribution of genotypes across the landscape, a process that should take up to 13 generations and therefore many years.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3amathematical models 3ageographical variation 3aheat sums 3aair temperature 3aplant characteristics 3aheight 3aclimate change 3aseasonal variation 3aPinus sylvestris 3agenetic variation 3apopulation 3aclimatic factors 3aprediction 3aSiberia 3aNorth America 0aRussia 0aprecipitation 0arussian far east 0awater availability1 aTchebakova, N.M.1 aParfenova, Y.I.1 aWykoff, W.R.1 aKuzmina, N.A.1 aMilyutin, L.I.0 tGlobal change biology.g2002 Sept., v.  8, no.  9 p.912-929x1354-10137nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl57021  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2002.00516.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/172193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c8d9e912  fGlob. chang. biol  aissued  a20080724b20080801c00000000  aIND232985169ExL  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  a2014-07-17  a20080724 20080801 00000000bIND CTR   aUSDA/FS  aagid:17219  a2011-03-19  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a356192603717nab a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003500098035002700133040001800160100018600178245009900364300001600463520138200479592002801861593001801889650002601907650001901933650003001952650001201982650001901994650001102013650005002024650001302074650001602087650001302103650002502116650001502141650002002156650001602176650001902192650001602211651002402227651001802251700002802269700002802297700003102325773009302356787003302449787001802482787002102500856008102521912001202602914004602614914002002660916001402680916001402694917001102708918002902719935002202748949001502770953003402785961001202819962004802831962004702879962004702926974001602973983001502989984001503004991600183420742620221121044904.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008182612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-014-1235-82doi  aagid:818261-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReeves, Matthew C.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Human Dimensions Program, PO Box 7669, 200 E.

Temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure deficit, day length, solar radiation, CO₂ enrichment and nitrogen deposition were evaluated as drivers of NPP. Across all three scenarios, rangeland NPP increased by 0.26 % year⁻¹ (7 kg C ha⁻¹ year⁻¹) but increases were not apparent until after 2030 and significant regional variation in NPP was revealed. The Desert Southwest and Southwest assessment regions exhibited declines in NPP of about 7 % by 2100, while the Northern and Southern Great Plains, Interior West and Eastern Prairies all experienced increases over 25 %. Grasslands dominated by warm season (C4 photosynthetic pathway) species showed the greatest response to temperature while cool season (C3 photosynthetic pathway) dominated regions responded most strongly to CO₂ enrichment. Modeled NPP responses compared favorably with experimental results from CO₂ manipulation experiments and to NPP estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Collectively, these results indicate significant and asymmetric changes in NPP for U.S. rangelands may be expected.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anitrogen 3aphotoperiod 3aprairies 3aprimary productivity 3arangelands 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3avapor pressure 3awarm season 3aGreat Plains region 3aUnited States1 aMoreno, Adam L.eauthor1 aBagne, Karen E.eauthor1 aRunning, Steven W.eauthor0 tClimatic change.g2014 Oct., v. 126, no. 3-4 p.429-442dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl895240uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1235-83Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl8952b0165-0009c126d3-4e429  fClimatic change  aBatch:728  aBatch:730  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6008182619ExL  a2015-01-20  aftp_PUB_14-09-23_05-25-18.zip  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:730 annotated on 2014-12-05T10:35:19Z  aBatch:730 reviewed on 2015-01-20T11:00:02Z  aBatch:730 reviewed on 2015-01-20T16:00:02Z  aagid:818261  a2014-10-14  a2014-10-1404979nab a2200757 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002700098035002800125040001800153100012400171245013200295300001800427500002000445520199100465592002802456593001802484650002002502650002402522650001102546650002502557650001902582650002402601650002002625650001502645650001102660650001502671650002102686650002002707650001102727650001502738650003202753650001602785650001002801650002102811650001202832650001602844700012602860700016102986700010003147700011403247700011803361700002503479773012303504787003303627787001803660787002203678856007303700912001203773914004503785914002603830916001503856917001103871918004303882935002203925949001503947953005703962954006104019955003404080961001204114962004804126974001704174983001504191984001504206991600596430742620221120025959.0180117e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058849322DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.138632doi  aagid:5884932-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, XiaohuieauthoruDepartment of Ecology, Evolution & Environmental Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA10aImproving predictions of tropical forest response to climate change through integration of field studies and ecosystem modeling  ap. e213-e232.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTropical forests play a critical role in carbon and water cycles at a global scale. Rapid climate change is anticipated in tropical regions over the coming decades and, under a warmer and drier climate, tropical forests are likely to be net sources of carbon rather than sinks. However, our understanding of tropical forest response and feedback to climate change is very limited. Efforts to model climate change impacts on carbon fluxes in tropical forests have not reached a consensus. Here, we use the Ecosystem Demography model (ED2) to predict carbon fluxes of a Puerto Rican tropical forest under realistic climate change scenarios. We parameterized ED2 with species‐specific tree physiological data using the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer workflow and projected the fate of this ecosystem under five future climate scenarios. The model successfully captured interannual variability in the dynamics of this tropical forest. Model predictions closely followed observed values across a wide range of metrics including aboveground biomass, tree diameter growth, tree size class distributions, and leaf area index. Under a future warming and drying climate scenario, the model predicted reductions in carbon storage and tree growth, together with large shifts in forest community composition and structure. Such rapid changes in climate led the forest to transition from a sink to a source of carbon. Growth respiration and root allocation parameters were responsible for the highest fraction of predictive uncertainty in modeled biomass, highlighting the need to target these processes in future data collection. Our study is the first effort to rely on Bayesian model calibration and synthesis to elucidate the key physiological parameters that drive uncertainty in tropical forests responses to climatic change. We propose a new path forward for model‐data synthesis that can substantially reduce uncertainty in our ability to model tropical forest responses to future climate.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aBayesian theory 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3ademography 3adrying 3aecosystems 3ahydrologic cycle 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3aprediction 3atree and stand measurements 3atree growth 3atrees 3atropical forests 3atropics 3auncertainty1 aUriarte, MaríaeauthoruDepartment of Ecology, Evolution & Environmental Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA1 aGonzález, GrizelleeauthoruInternational Institute of Tropical Forestry, United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Río Piedras, Puerto Rico1 aReed, SashaeauthoruSouthwest Biological Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey, Moab, UT, USA1 aThompson, JilleauthoruDepartment of Environmental Science, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico1 aZimmerman, Jess K.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental Science, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico1 aMurphy, Loraeauthor0 tGlobal change biology.g2018 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.e213-e232dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl5702140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.138633Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl57021b1354-1013c24d1ee213  fGlobal change biology  aBatch:1908  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6058849329ExL  a2018-03-09  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/13541013_2018_24_1.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/13541013_2018_24_1.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aUSDA/FS  aBatch:1908 reviewed on 2018-03-09T13:00:02Z  aagid:5884932  a2018-01-17  a2018-03-0904771nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098024003800139035002800177040001800205100022000223245007900443500002200522506007600544506003100620520134400651592002801995593001802023596006002041506003702101650003102138650001702169650002502186650001902211650002502230650002302255650002302278650002502301650001702326650001102343650002302354650001402377650001502391651001502406653001902421653001302440653002402453653002002477700013602497700011602633700017002749700013402919700013303053773010203186787003303288787001803321787001903339856008503358856004503443912001203488914004103500914002303541916001503564917001103579918003603590935002203626949001503648953009103663954006103754955003503815961001603850962004703866962001703913974001703930983001503947984001503962991600751680742620221215143329.0190906e20191029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066172162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.1010082chorus7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.1010082doi  aagid:6617216-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnderwood, Emma C.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA; Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK14aThe impacts of climate change on ecosystem services in southern California  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aClimate change is projected to impact ecosystem functioning, however its effect on the provision of ecosystem services is uncertain. This is particularly relevant on federal lands which harbor extensive tracts of natural vegetation. We assessed change in four ecosystem services (water runoff, groundwater recharge, carbon storage, and biodiversity) and one disservice (sediment export) in southern California between current and end-of-century (2070-2099). We used five general circulation models ranging from warmer wetter (CNRM-CM5, CCSM4) to hotter, marginally drier (IPSL-CM5A-LR) to hotter drier (FGOALS-g2, MIROC-ESM) under RCP8.5. We found greatest projected change in water runoff, from an increase of 127% under a warmer wetter GCM to a decrease of -60% under a hotter drier future. Carbon storage is projected to change the least, from an increase of 52% to a decrease of -31% across GCMs. We also determined that one-third of high biodiversity areas are threatened by high change in climatic water deficit. We estimated the current monetized annual value of sediment removal costs to be $172 million per year and the economic value of carbon storage as $7.5 billion. Understanding the impacts of climate change on ecosystem services can help develop climate-smart strategies for the sustainable management of natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000069590 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3abiodiversity 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aecological footprint 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3agroundwater recharge 3apublic lands 3arunoff 3asediment transport 3asediments 3avegetation 3aCalifornia 0acarbon storage 0arecharge 0aresource management 0asediment export1 aHollander, Allan D.eauthoruDepartment of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA1 aSafford, Hugh D.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region, 1323 Club Dive, Vallejo, CA 94592, USA1 aKim, John B.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3720-79161 aSrivastava, LorieeauthoruDepartment of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA1 aDrapek, Ray J.eauthoruUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA0 tEcosystem services.g2019 Oct. 29, v. 39 p.101008-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)2160940uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.1010083Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/6617216  aArticle  aJournal:21609b2212-0416c39e101008  fEcosystem services  aBatch:2375  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6066172169ExL  a2019-12-18  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/155748784175683403-00003-HEAD-ONLY-NEW CONSYN ISSNS.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S2212041618306314.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/FSUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 2212-0416  aMissing ISSN  aagid:6617216  a2019-09-06  a2022-10-0404757nab a2200805 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004100098024003800139035002800177040001800205100009400223245012600317506007600443506003100519520175900550592002802309593001802337596008302355506003702438650002102475650001202496650001502508650001202523650001902535650002702554650001502581650002202596650001302618650001002631650002002641650001502661650001102676650001202687650003502699650002402734650001702758650001302775653002402788653001002812653001702822653001602839700009902855700009802954700009703052773010803149787003303257787001803290787002203308856008503330856004503415912001203460914004503472914002803517916001503545917001103560918003603571935002203607949001503629953009103644954006103735955003503796961000903831962004703840962001703887974001703904983001503921984001503936991600759780742620221215143329.0201023e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070806212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2020.1087312chorus7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2020.1087312doi  aagid:7080621-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Evan C.eauthoruDept. of Forest & Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin, USA14aThe past, present and future impacts of climate and land use change on snowshoe hares along their southern range boundary  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aChanges in land use and climate are among the main drivers of range shifts for multiple species and taxa. While such distributional changes are often observed at broad scales, the processes driving them – colonization and extinction along range boundaries – occur at local scales. There is a need then, to identify whether these local drivers are consistent with patterns at broader scales. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), an important prey species in northern forest ecosystems, have experienced range contraction along much of their southern boundary. Population declines are linked to climate change via camouflage mismatch, an inability to match seasonal coat color molts with declining snow cover duration. We used data from camera traps to monitor the spatial extent and habitat associations of hares before, during and after an experimental translocation, and multi-season occupancy models to model the effects of habitat and climate on colonization and extinction patterns. We compared our contemporary occupancy models to historical patterns of extirpation and simulated future effects of timber harvest on occupancy. Colonization by hares was strongly associated with distance from source population and patch size of aspen-alder. Historical patterns of extirpation were consistent with contemporary patterns, and simulations revealed that increased frequency and magnitude of aspen harvest increased hare occupancy by creating large patches of early-successional habitat. As global change alters ecological communities, identifying mechanisms that drive range-shifts and targeting landscape features that can be manipulated to buffer those effects can be used to promote the persistence of individual species and ecological communities.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLepus americanus 3acameras 3acamouflage 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecological communities 3aextinction 3aforest ecosystems 3ahabitats 3ahares 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amolting 3anatural resources conservation 3apopulation dynamics 3aprey species 3asnowpack 0aCamouflage mismatch 0aAspen 0aColonization 0aRange shift1 aZuckerberg, BenjamineauthoruDept. of Forest & Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin, USA1 aPeery, M.

We are using the output from four General Circulation Models downscaled by the method of Localized Constructed Analogues and provided by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The daily data were used by SIO to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and derive a suite of 24 hydrologic and climate variables at a 1/16° (ca. 6 km) grid scale, for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). Here we focus on trends in the return levels of extreme climatic events, including annual maximum daily discharge of six basin streams, maximum and total annual kinetic energy (KE) of raindrops falling on snow-free ground, basin-wide climatic water deficit, and wind speed. To analyze time trends in historic and modeled future extreme values, we applied the program extRemes, based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Values of KE on snow-free ground were derived by statistically disaggregating daily rainfall to hourly, and using literature values to convert rainfall intensity (mm/hr) for days without snowpack to KE (Joules/m²/hr). We found strong upward trends in extreme values, with most of the effect due to loss of snowpack, but a significant effect of increasing rainfall for one model. To estimate future trends in maximum annual daily discharge of six streams, we adjusted the modeled future annual maximum runoff to the distribution of gage data, using regression of gage data on modeled historic runoff at equal return intervals. The GEV results for the six streams, averaged across the four models, indicate an increase in the 20-year flood of 65–117 percent. Climatic water deficit showed strong upward trends for three of the four models, with a maximum at mid-century for one model. Averaged across the basin and across the four models, average and maximum seasonal winds under RCP 8.5 are projected to decrease slightly in all seasons. The trends in averages and extreme values that we found will have important effects on vegetation, wildfire severity, flood hazards and the clarity of Lake Tahoe.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3abasins 3aclimate change 3afire severity 3akinetic energy 3alakes 3aoceanography 3arain 3arain intensity 3arunoff 3asnowpack 3avegetation 3awind speed 0aTahoe 0aClimate change 0aClimate models 0aPrecipitation 0aTemperature 0aFloods1 aLewis, JackeauthoruUSDA Forest Service (Ret.), P.O.

The workshop follows the culmination of a nation-wide effort assessing the current state of knowledge of air quality impacts on agricultural production, and vice-versa. This benchmark effort necessitates further discussion, addressing remaining knowledge gaps and progress barriers with the expectation of a changing climate. The goal of the workshop was to identify these needs for the Southwest and Southern Plains region. Convening professionals from health, agricultural, and environmental sectors, the workshop resulted in the following roadmap of priorities intended for those in policy, research, and land management. These priorities include greater attention to the areas and communities missed in monitoring efforts, enhanced data accessibility and communication across sectors, and increased support for research and monitoring by state and federal governments, among others.  aPubAg article  a865balice.allenc2022-05-12damanda.xue2022-05-18  eARIS manuscript 3aUSDA 3aair quality 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aissues and policy 3aland management1 aElias, Emile H.eauthoruUSDA Southwest Climate Hub1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9964-31771 aWebb, NicholaseauthoruResearch Associate and Professor, Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico State University1 aZwicke, GregeauthoruAir Quality Engineer, Air Quality and Atmospheric Change Team, USDA-NRCS1 aDy, TimothyeauthoruTD Environmental Services, LLC1 aAney, SkyeeauthoruProject Manager, Jornada Experimental Range, USDA Southwest Climate Hub1 aBrady, MichaeleauthoruNatural Resources Conservation Service, Denver, Colorado1 aBrown, Joel R.eauthoruNatural Resources Conservation Service, USDA Southwest Climate Hub, and USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, New Mexico1 aDobos, Robert R.eauthoruNatural Resources Conservation Service, Lincoln, Nebraska1 aDubois, DaveeauthoruNew Mexico Climate Center, and Plant and Environmental Sciences, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico1 aEdwards, Brandon L.eauthoruUSDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, and Plant and Environmental Sciences, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico1 aHeimel, SierraeauthoruUSDA Southwest Climate Hub, Las Cruces, New Mexico1 aLuke, NicholaseauthoruNew Mexico Climate Center, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico1 aRottler, Caitlin M.eauthoruSouth Central Climate Adaptation Science Center, Norman, Oklahoma1 aSteele, CaitrianaeauthoruUSDA Southwest Climate Hub, and USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range, and Plant and Environmental Sciences, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico0 tBulletin of the American Meteorological Society.g2021 July 20, v. 102, no. 7 p.E1394-E1401wJournal:jnl4623929x0003-00077nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl462392940uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-21-0088.13Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl4623929b1520-0477c102d7eE1394  fBulletin of the American Meteorological Society  aissued  aIND6074819849ExL  a2022-05-13  dNAL-AP-2-clean  aUSDAbUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1520-0477  aagid:7481984  a2021-08-21  a2022-05-1304521nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024001700121024004600138035002800184040001800212100008100230245010600311300001400417506017300431520165400604593001802258593002002276595005302296593002002349650002202369650001902391650001502410650001902425650002502444650001702469650001902486650002402505650002502529650001802554650002002572650001102592650002702603650002902630650002302659650002502682650001502707650001302722650001402735650002202749650001502771650002402786650001202810650001202822650001702834773010602851787003302957787001802990787001903008856009203027912001203119914003603131914004603167916001603213917001103229935002203240949001503262952001503277956020403292961000903496962004703505974001703552983001503569984001503584985011603599986001203715991601841820742620221214230229.0180404e20160208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068381872DNAL7 a10113/68381872hdl7 a2992362aris7 a10.2134/advagricsystmodel6.2013.00042doi  aagid:6838187-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGollany, HeroeauthoruUSDA-ARS-CPCRC, 48037 Tubbs Ranch Rd., Adams, OR 978110aCQESTR Simulation of Dryland Agroecosystem Soil Organic Carbon Changes under Climate Change Scenarios  ap. 59-87.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe potential effects of global climate change (CC) on C cycling and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage/loss in agroecosystems can only be assessed by process-based models such as CQESTR. This model was used to simulate the effect of tillage and N fertilization on soil C storage/loss in 3 long-term experiments, where a wheat-fallow rotation under dryland is the predominant practice. Using a 30 yr simulation approach, the effects of biomass increases/decreases, intensifying cropping and two decades of potential CC scenarios on SOC stock under 0 and 135 kg N ha(-1) (0N and 135N) in conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) were examined. These SOC stocks were also compared with those of a pasture (GP). With a 30% increase in biomass, predicted SOC stock in the topsoil of the GP increased by 22% under current climate compared to CC scenario, and the topsoil was more affected by CC than the subsoil. A loss of SOC was predicted at 0-30 and 30-60 cm depths for the CT-0N in all scenarios. The same was true for the CT-135N and NT-0N, except SOC gains of 0.26 and 1.37 Mg ha(-1) were predicted, respectively, in continuous winter wheat under CC scenarios. The NT-135N was the only treatment with SOC gains ranging from 1.35 Mg ha(-1), in wheat-fallow system with 30% biomass reduction, to 8.61 Mg ha(-1) in continuous wheat. The C sink capacities of the NT-135N, NT-0N, CT-135N, and CT-0N were 12.69, 14.54, 13.46 and 18.57 Mg ha(-1), respectively, relative to the GP.

The market for carbon credits has grown rapidly within the recent years and has been projected to exceed $500 billion in trades by 2020. This developing situation certainly warrants watching by rangeland interests. Rising carbon credit prices would certainly make investments in rangeland mitigation projects a financially attractive, and an environmentally proactive, alternative to traditional land management. However, as a relatively small portion of any potential private sector carbon market, terrestrial sequestration in general, and rangelands in particular, must operate efficiently within the market (prices and rules) and exploit inherent competitive advantages. Rangeland carbon sequestration projects are competitive because of the relatively low cost of achieving increased soil carbon storage and its compatibility with existing management operations and production systems. On the other hand, documenting and verifying changes in carbon storage is a daunting challenge. The success of rangeland projects as participants in a private sector market will be determined in large part by the ability of the rangeland management profession (scientists, advisors, and managers) to develop accurate, credible, and cost-effective protocols to ensure to both buyers and the public that gains are real.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3arange management 3agreenhouse gases 3apollution control 3arangelands 3acarbon markets 3aclimate change 3acarbon sequestration 3agas emissions 3aissues and policy 3aUnited States 0acap-and-trade arrangements 0aenvironmental markets1 aBrown, Joel R.1 aThorpe, Jim0 tRangelands.g2008 June, v.  30, no.  3 p.7-11x1551-501X7nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)3143  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/319793Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111/1551-501X(2008)30[7:CTTMOC]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:3143b1551-501Xc30d3e7  fRangelands  aissued  a20090804b20091002c00000000  aIND442349569ExL  aINDdLYNe2009/07/31  aOther US  a2014-07-17  a20090804 20091002 00000000bIND LYN 2009/07/31  aUSDA/NRCS  aagid:31979  a2012-06-07  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a423495604678nab a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024003900098035002800137040001800165100013000183245013400313300001800447500001500465520188900480592002802369593001802397650002102415650001902436650002402455650002502479650001702504650000902521650002202530650002002552650002902572650002002601650002402621650001102645650000902656650001902665650001202684650001302696650001202709650002502721650001302746650001502759650002402774653001102798653002202809653001402831653003302845653003002878653004002908653000802948700011902956700012303075773012903198787003303327787001803360787001903378856008603397912001203483914004003495914003403535916001503569917001103584918003603595935002203631949001503653953006003668954006103728955003503789961001303824974001703837983001503854984001503869991602431840742620221120095845.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056520372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.1352doi  aagid:5652037-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPourhashem, GhasideheauthoruCenter for Energy Studies, Baker Institute for Public Policy, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA10aTime effects of climate change mitigation strategies for second generation biofuels and co-products with temporary carbon storage  ap. 2642-2653.  a2019-12-06  aSecond generation biofuels offer a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and storing or delaying soil carbon emissions relative to petroleum-based fuels depending upon the strategy used to synthesize the biofuel and co-products. Unless mitigated, the soil organic carbon and nitrogen loss resulting from removing agricultural residues for biofuel production may cause life cycle greenhouse gas emissions to surpass national policy thresholds, and thus risk non-compliance with renewable fuel policy. Strategies to mitigate soil organic carbon loss such as using nutrient and carbon-rich, and stable land amendments will lead to time-variable greenhouse gas credits. Recent studies have argued for using time-dependent rather than time-averaged radiative forcing methods for biofuel greenhouse gas accounting but few life cycle assessment studies have examined the impact of time-varying emissions of soil organic carbon using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tier 3 models. This study applies a time-dependent radiative forcing approach to a 100-year time-series data set of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions for lignocellulosic ethanol that includes temporally variable soil greenhouse gas emissions. This study demonstrates that averaging soil emissions and neglecting the time when the sequestration or release occurs within a selected time horizon can lead to a 9% to over 80% overestimation of the magnitude of the effect of the mitigation strategy. This affirms that employing strategies to maintain soil organic carbon stock early within a biofuel program supports climate change mitigation. Such strategies would guide farmers to best manage soil carbon within the biofuel production life cycle. Time-dependent approaches underscore the need for early measures of greenhouse gas curtailment to support sustainable renewable biofuel and agricultural policy.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3agreenhouse gases 3alignocellulose 3asoil organic carbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3arisk 3aradiative forcing 3afuel production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3adata collection 3aagricultural wastes 3amodels 3asoil 3aclimate change 3aethanol 3anitrogen 3afarmers 3atime series analysis 3abiofuels 3acoproducts 3aagricultural policy 0acarbon 0aRadiative forcing 0aBioenergy 0aSoil carbon storage and loss 0aGreenhouse gas accounting 0aAgricultural residue-based biofuels 0aLCA1 aAdler, Paul R.eauthoruUSDA-ARS, Pasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit, University Park, PA, USA1 aSpatari, SabrinaeauthoruCivil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.2642-2653dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)1196740uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.1353Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:11967b0959-6526c112e2642  fJournal of cleaner production  aBatch:1781  aissued2 aElsevier Consyneprovider5DNAL  aIND6056520379ExL  a2018-09-01  a/data/metadata/incoming/consyn/22-2-00061-HEAD-ONLY.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/consyn/S095965261501375X.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/consyn/  aUSDA/ARS  aagid:5652037  a2018-08-31  a2018-08-3105718nab a2200721 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024004200098035002800140040001800168100027200186245011900458300001600577500002000593520223400613592002802847593001802875650002302893650001702916650001402933650001902947650001902966650002102985650001503006650002203021650002103043650002203064650001203086650001103098650001303109650000903122650001503131650000903146650001603155650002503171650001003196651001403206700027203220700026903492700027003761700027204031773012504303787003304428787001804461787002204479856008904501912001204590914004404602914003104646916001504677917001104692918004304703935002204746949001504768953005704783954006104840955003404901961001404935974001704949983001504966984001504981991602652990742620221122025328.0180619e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058835452DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00777.x2doi  aagid:5883545-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKriticos, D.

Understanding the likely potential distribution of this notorious plant under current and future climate scenarios will enable policy makers and land managers to prepare appropriate strategies to manage the invasion. 2 CLIMEX was used to synthesize available information from diverse sources to model the invasion potential of A. nilotica and gain insights into the climatic factors limiting its range expansion. The model identified areas at risk of further invasion so that early preventative or ameliorative measures could be undertaken in a timely manner. 3 The potential distribution of A. nilotica in Australia under current climatic conditions is vast, and far greater than the current distribution. 4 Global climate change is likely to increase markedly the potential distribution of A. nilotica in Australia, significantly increasing the area at risk of invasion. The factors of most importance are the expected increases in water‐use efficiency of A. nilotica due to increased atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, allowing it to invade more xeric sites further inland, and increased temperatures, allowing it to complete its reproductive life cycle further southward (poleward). 5 Synthesis and applications. Simple paddock quarantine procedures may provide a means of limiting the range of A. nilotica within its potential distribution under current, as well as future, climate scenarios. The projected increased growth potential of A. nilotica throughout its current range suggests that if future management patterns result in seed pods lying unconsumed on the ground, heightened vigilance may be required to identify and eradicate new invasion foci arising from flood dispersal. The increased growth potential may also result in an alteration of the economic balance, in favour of harvesting A. nilotica for agroforestry or local bioenergy projects. A crucial component in containing this invasion will be raising public awareness of the invasion threat posed by A. nilotica, its identification and suitable control techniques.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article 3aVachellia nilotica 3aagroforestry 3abioenergy 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aharvesting 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3alegumes 3amodels 3apastures 3apods 3aquarantine 3arisk 3atemperature 3awater use efficiency 3aweeds 3aAustralia1 aSutherst, R.

For northeastern Brazil, five global circulation models were selected using a rainfall seasonal evaluation screening technique from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change named Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. The climate variables were generated for the base period of 1971–2000, as were projections for the 2025–2055 future time slice. Removal of maximum and minimum temperature and rainfall output bias was used to estimate reference evapotranspiration, irrigation water needs, and river flow using the rainfall—river flow hydrological model Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure for the baseline and future climate (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios). In addition, by applying improved irrigation efficiency, a scenario was evaluated in comparison with field observed performance. The water-deficit index was used as a water availability performance indicator. Future climate projections by all five models resulted in increases in future reference evapotranspiration (2.3–6.3%) and irrigation water needs (2.8–16.7%) for all scenarios. Regarding rainfall projections, both positive (4.8–12.5%) and negative (− 2.3 to − 15.2%) signals were observed. Most models and scenarios project that annual river flow will decrease. Lower future water availability was detected by the less positive water-deficit index. Improved irrigation efficiency is a key measure for the adaptation to higher future levels of water demand, as climate change impacts could be compensated by gains in irrigation efficiency (water demand changes varying from − 1.7 to − 35.2%).  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aMP1cEmbrapa  aAdaptacCNPq 3abasins 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic models 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3arain 3arivers 3ascreening 3asoil water 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aBrazil1 aSilveira, CleitoneauthoruUnilab, Campus da Liberdade, Avenida da Abolição, 3-Centro, Redenção, CE, CEP 62790-000, Brazil1 ade Souza Filho, FranciscoeauthoruDepartamento de Engenharia Hidráulica e Ambiental, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Bloco 713, 1.° Andar, Centro de Tecnologia, Fortaleza, CE, CEP 60451-970, Brazil1 aVasconcelos, Francisco, Jr.cJr.eauthoruDepartamento de Engenharia Hidráulica e Ambiental, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Bloco 713, 1.° Andar, Centro de Tecnologia, Fortaleza, CE, CEP 60451-970, Brazil1 aCid, DanieleauthoruDepartamento de Engenharia Hidráulica e Ambiental, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Bloco 713, 1.° Andar, Centro de Tecnologia, Fortaleza, CE, CEP 60451-970, Brazil0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 Aug., v. 77, no. 15 p.550-550dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)J00000122840uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7723-93Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:J000001228b1866-6280c77d15e550  fEnvironmental earth sciences  aBatch:2067  aissued2 aSpringereprovider5DNAL  aIND6060723949ExL  a2018-09-25  a/data/metadata/incoming/springer/ftp_PUB_18-09-03_09-51-40.zip  afile:/data/metadata/staging/springer/12665-77-15.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/springer/  aUSDA/DA  aBatch:2067 reviewed on 2018-09-25T04:00:04Z  aagid:6072394  a2018-09-04  a2018-09-2505855nab a2200901 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001700098024002300115024003300138024001200171035002800183040001800211100010100229245010600330300001600436500002000452500000900472506017300481520204600654592002802700593001802728594002202746595005202768596004002820596001502860596002702875593002002902650001902922650002202941650001502963650001202978650001902990650002003009650001803029650001103047650002003058650001103078650001503089650000803104650000903112650002403121650001703145651001703162700010403179700010003283700010303383700010003486700010003586773021703686787003303903787001803936787002103954856011403975856008004089912001204169914002004181914003704201916001504238917001104253918004304264935002204307949001504329953005704344954006104401955003404462956021204496961001304708962003004721962004704751962004804798962004804846974001704894983001504911984001504926986001204941991602942370742620221214224421.0220811e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059355992DNAL7 a3406922aris7 a10113/59355992hdl7 a10.2134/jeq2017.04.01612doi8 ans13873  aagid:5935599-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNash, P.

The objectives of this study were: (i) to simulate SOC dynamics in the top 30 cm of soil during a 20‐yr (1993–2012) field study using CQESTR, a process‐based C model; (ii) to predict the impact of changes in management, crop production, and climate change from 2013 to 2032; and (iii) to identify the best dryland cropping systems to maintain or increase SOC stocks under projected climate change in central North Dakota. Intensifying crop rotations was predicted to have a greater impact on SOC stocks than tillage (minimum tillage [MT], no‐till [NT]) during 2013 to 2032, as SOC was highly correlated to biomass input (r = 0.91, P = 0.00053). Converting from a MT spring wheat (SW, Triticum aestivum L.)–fallow rotation to a NT continuous SW rotation increased annualized biomass additions by 2.77 Mg ha⁻¹ (82%) and SOC by 0.22 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. Under the assumption that crop production will stay at the 1993 to 2012 average, climate change is predicted to have a minor impact on SOC (approximately −6.5%) relative to crop rotation management. The CQESTR model predicted that the addition of another SW or rye (Secale cereale L.) crop would have a greater effect on SOC stocks (0‐ to 30‐cm depth) than conversion from MT to NT or climate change from 2013 to 2032. CORE IDEAS: Improved estimates of SOC responses to management are needed in dryland regions. Soil organic C stocks were highly correlated to biomass input. Crop rotation was predicted to have a greater impact on SOC stocks than tillage. Anticipated climate change as of 2032 was predicted to have a minor impact on SOC stocks. Addition of another spring wheat or rye crop would increase SOC by 2032.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article  baallenc2018-05-08dmanager-lgarnere2018-05-09  cUSDA‐ARS National Program Leaders  cUSDA‐ARS  cARS‐GRACEnet project  eARIS manuscript 3aSecale cereale 3aTriticum aestivum 3aarid lands 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3acrop rotation 3afallow 3aminimum tillage 3amodels 3ano-tillage 3arye 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3aspring wheat 3aNorth Dakota1 aGollany, H.

The objectives of this study were: (i) to use CQESTR, a process‐based C model, to simulate SOC dynamics from 2006 to 2011 and to predict relative SOC trends in cropping sequences that included barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), and fallow under conventional tillage or no‐till, and N fertilization rates through 2045; and (ii) to identify best dryland cropping systems to increase SOC and reduce CO₂ emissions under projected climate change in eastern Montana. Cropping sequences were conventional‐till barley–fallow (CTB‐F), no‐till barley–fallow (NTB‐F), no‐till continuous barley (NTCB), and no‐till barley–pea (NTB‐P), with 0 and 80 kg N ha⁻¹ applied to barley. Under current crop production, climatic conditions, and averaged N rates, SOC at the 0‐ to 10‐cm depth was predicted to increase by 1.74, 1.79, 2.96, and 4.57 Mg C ha⁻¹ by 2045 for CTB‐F, NTB‐F, NTB‐P, and NTCB, respectively. When projected climate change and the current positive US barley yield trend were accounted for in the simulations, SOC accretion was projected to increase by 0.69 to 0.92 Mg C ha⁻¹ and 0.41 to 0.47 Mg C ha⁻¹, respectively. According to the model simulations, adoption of NT, elimination of fallow years, and N fertilizer management will likely have the greatest impact on SOC stocks in the top soil as of 2045 in the Northern Great Plains. CORE IDEAS: Estimates of management impact on SOC are needed for the Northern Great Plains region. CQESTR simulated measured SOC well, even with high temporal and spatial variability. Continuous cropping and anticipated climate change increased SOC stocks through 2045. Maintaining barley yield was predicted to reverse the trend in SOC loss through 2045.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article  baallenc2018-05-08dmanager-lgarnere2018-05-09  cUSDA‐ARS  cARS GRACEnet Project  eARIS manuscript 3aHordeum vulgare 3aPisum sativum 3aarid lands 3abarley 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aconventional tillage 3acropping sequence 3afallow 3afertilizer rates 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anitrogen fertilizers 3ano-tillage 3apeas 3asimulation models 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3atopsoil 3aGreat Plains region 3aMontana1 aGollany, H.

Conservation (CnT) tillage and winter cover cropping are current management practices to rebuild SOC; however, there is sparse long‐term field data showing how these management practices perform under variable climate conditions. The objectives of this study were to use CQESTR, a process‐based C model, to simulate SOC in the top 15 cm of a loamy sand soil (fine‐loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kandiudult) under conventional (CvT) or CnT tillage to elucidate the impact of projected climate change and crop yields on SOC relative to management and recommend the best agriculture management to increase SOC. Conservation tillage was predicted to increase SOC by 0.10 to 0.64 Mg C ha⁻¹ for six of eight crop rotations compared with CvT by 2033. The addition of a winter crop [rye (Secale cereale L.) or winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)] to a corn (Zea mays L.)–cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) or corn–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation increased SOC by 1.47 to 2.55 Mg C ha⁻¹. A continued increase in crop yields following historical trends could increase SOC by 0.28 Mg C ha⁻¹, whereas climate change is unlikely to have a significant impact on SOC except in the corn–cotton or corn–soybean rotations where SOC decreased up to 0.15 Mg C ha⁻¹ by 2033. The adoption of CnT and cover crop management with high‐residue‐producing corn will likely increase SOC accretion in loamy sand soils. Simulation results indicate that soil C saturation may be reached in high‐residue rotations, and increasing SOC deeper in the soil profile will be required for long‐term SOC accretion beyond 2030. CORE IDEAS: High‐residue crop rotation in conservation tillage maximized SOC accumulation. Cover crop and conservation tillage management would likely optimize SOC accretion. Anticipated climate change was predicted to have a minimal impact on SOC by 2033. Sorghum was not a viable option to replace corn in rotation for SOC accretion. Alternative management was required for deep SOC accretion beyond 2033.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article  baallenc2018-05-08dmanager-lgarnere2018-05-09  cUSDA‐ARS National Program Leaders  cUSDA‐ARS  cARS‐GRACEnet project  eARIS manuscript 3aGlycine max 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aKandiudults 3aSecale cereale 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aclimate change 3aconservation tillage 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3acover crops 3acrop rotation 3acrop yield 3ahumid zones 3aloamy sand soils 3amodels 3arye 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3awinter 3awinter wheat1 aGollany, H.

The objective was to use CQESTR, a process‐based C model, and SOC data collected in 2004, 2008, and 2012 to predict the best management to increase SOC under changing climate in four cropping systems, which included continuous wheat under no tillage (W–W/NT), wheat and sorghum × sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench. × Sorghum sudanese L.] under no tillage, wheat–fallow under sweep tillage, and W–F/MP. Since future yields and climate are uncertain, 20 scenarios for each cropping system were simulated with four climate projections and five crop yield scenarios (current crop yields, and 10 or 30% greater or lesser yields). Measured and simulated SOC were significantly (p < 0.0001) correlated (r = 0.98) at all soil depths. Predicted SOC changes ranged from −12.03 to 2.56 Mg C ha⁻¹ in the 1‐m soil depth for W–F/MP and W–W/NT, respectively, during the 2012 to 2052 predictive period. Only W–W/NT sequestered SOC at a rate of 0.06 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ under current crop yields and climate. Under climate change and yield scenarios, W–W/NT lost SOC except with a 30% wheat yield increase for 40 yr. Predicted SOC increases in W–W/NT were 0.71, 1.16, and 0.88 Mg C ha⁻¹ under the Oregon Climate Assessment Reports for low emissions and high emissions and the Regional Climate Model version 3 with boundary conditions from the Third Generation Coupled Global Climate Model, respectively, with 30% yield increases. Continuous no‐till cropping would increase SOC and improve soil health and resiliency to lessen the impact of extreme weather. CORE IDEAS: Measured and CQESTR‐simulated SOC were significantly correlated at all soil depths. Continuous wheat with no tillage increased SOC unless yield was reduced by 30% or more. Wheat yield increase is needed to maintain SOC in continuous wheat under climate change. Dryland cropping systems will have SOC losses unless yield and biomass input is increased. Soil organic C loss rates increased with tillage intensity and increased fallow period.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  aEmbargoed article  bksichelmanc2018-05-08dmanager-lgarnere2018-05-09  cUSDA‐ARS  cARS‐GRACEnet  eARIS manuscript 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii 3aTriticum aestivum 3aarid lands 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acropping systems 3adata collection 3aemissions 3aenvironmental assessment 3agrain yield 3ano-tillage 3aplows 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3aweather 3awinter wheat 3aOregon1 aPolumsky, Robert W.eauthoruUSDA Agricultural Research Service, Columbia Plateau Conservation Research Center, 48037 Tubbs Ranch Rd., Adams, OR, 978100 tJournal of environmental quality.g2018 July, v. 47, no. 4 p.625-634dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)jnl164240uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/59356023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2017.09.03743Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl1642e1  fJournal of environmental quality  aBatch:1990  aissued2 aJohn Wiley & Sons, Inceprovider5DNAL  aIND6059356029ExL  a2019-10-28  a/data/metadata/incoming/wiley/00472425_2018_47_4.xml  afile:/data/metadata/staging/wiley/00472425_2018_47_4.xml  a/data/metadata/staging/wiley/  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Simulating%20soil%20organic%20carbon%20responses%20to%20cropping%20intensity%2C%20tillage%2C%20and%20climate%20change%20in%20pacific%20northwest%20dryland.pdf  aUSDA/RD  aUSDA Scientist Submission  aUSDA Scientist Submission, eISSN 1537-2537  aBatch:1990 reviewed on 2018-06-15T14:07:06Z  aBatch:1990 reviewed on 2018-07-18T10:00:03Z  aagid:5935602  a2022-08-11  a2022-08-11  ans1400704542nab a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024002300098024003800121024004100159035002800200040001800228100010000246245017800346300001500524506007600539506003100615506002800646506003600674520177000710592002802480593001802508596004702526596002202573596001002595506003702605650002002642650001102662650001202673650001502685650001402700650001102714650002502725650001902750650002002769650001902789650002002808650001202828650001502840650002002855650001602875700012502891700012403016773009303140787003303233787001803266787001803284856008403302912001203386914002603398914002003424917001103444918002703455935002203482949001503504952001903519955003403538961000903572962004703581974001703628983003003645984001503675985010603690991603070650742620221215143557.0220901e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073309122DNAL7 a10113/73309122hdl7 a10.1016/j.neunet.2018.08.0042doi7 a10.1016/j.neunet.2018.08.0042chorus  aagid:7330912-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, AndreseauthoruRWTH Aachen University, Department of Geography, 52062 Aachen, Germany10aEstimating regional effects of climate change and altered land use on biosphere carbon fluxes using distributed time delay neural networks with Bayesian regularized learning  ap. 97-113.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aThe ability to accurately predict changes of the carbon and energy balance on a regional scale is of great importance for assessing the effect of land use changes on carbon sequestration under future climate conditions. Here, a suite of land cover-specific Distributed Time Delay Neural Networks with a parameter adoption algorithm optimized through Bayesian regularization was used to model the statewide atmospheric exchange of CO(2), water vapor, and energy in Oregon with its strong spatial gradients of climate and land cover. The network models were trained with eddy covariance data from 9 atmospheric flux towers. Compared to results derived with more common regression networks utilizing non-delayed input vectors, the performance of the DTDNN models was significantly improved with an average increase of the coefficients of determination of 64%. The optimized models were applied in combination with downscaled climate projections of the CMIP5 project to calculate future changes in the cycle of carbon, associated with a prescribed conversion of conventional grass-crops to hybrid poplar plantations for biofuel production in Oregon. The results show that under future RCP8.5 climate conditions the total statewide NEP increases by 0.87 TgC per decade until 2050 without any land use changes. With all non-forage grass completely converted to hybrid poplar the NEP averages 32.9 TgC in 2046–2050, an increase of 9%. Through comparisons with the results of a Bayesians inversion study, the results presented demonstrate that DTDNN models are a specifically well-suited approach to use the available data from flux networks to assess changes in biosphere–atmosphere exchange triggered by massive land use conversion superimposed on a changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data  aPubAg article  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cOffice of Science  cUSDOE0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aOregon 3aPopulus 3aalgorithms 3abiosphere 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy balance 3afuel production 3agrasses 3aland cover 3aland use change 3awater vapor1 aCreason, WhitneyeauthoruOregon State University, Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA1 aLaw, Beverly E.eauthoruOregon State University, Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA0 tNeural Networks.g2018 Dec., v. 108 p.97-113dElsevier BVwJournal:3765x0893-60807nnas1 oislandora_article_repository1 oproduct_pubag1 o(Journal)376540uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2018.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aArticle  aJournal:3765c108e97  fNeural Networks  aissued2 aCHORUSeprovider5DNAL  aIND6073309129ExL  a2022-05-11  dNAL-AP-2-clean  a/data/metadata/staging/chorus  aUSDA  aUSDA Scientist Submission; eISSN 1879-2782  aagid:7330912  a2022-09-01T12:43:51-04:00  a2022-10-04  aXML source generated via Python using CHORUS API JSON data; converted to MODS with chorus_to_mods.xsl04225nab a2200829 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003800097024002100135035002600156040001800182072000900200072000900209072000900218072000900227100002100236245010300257300001600360500002400376500001500400520160800415593001802023593002002041650002202061650002202083650002502105650001902130650002802149650002202177650002302199650001602222650002002238650002202258650002102280650002202301650001702323650001402340650002102354650002002375650002202395650001802417650002102435651001202456653002702468653002202495700001802517700002502535773011002560787001802670787003302688787003002721787002102751852000902772856011202781856008802893912001202981914004402993914003403037917001103071930003303082935002103115945002503136946001103161949001503172952005103187961001203238974001503250984001503265985010303280986001203383991603215780742620100208070030.0100115e20100205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443136482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.08.0212doi7 a10113/382152hdl  aagid:38215-01nal_inst  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK200 0aB200 0aF300 0aX1001 aHanewinkel, Marc10aModelling and economic evaluation of forest biome shifts under climate change in Southwest Germany  ap. 710-719.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWe evaluated the economic effects of a predicted shift from Norway spruce (Picea abies (Karst) to European beech (Fagus sylvatica (L) for a forest area of 1.3 millionha in southwest Germany. The shift was modelled with a generalised linear model (GLM) by using presence/absence data from the National Forest Inventory in Baden-Württemberg, a digital elevation model, and regionalised climate parameters from the period 1970 to 2000. Two scenarios from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (B1, A2) for three different time scales (2030, 2065, and 2100) were investigated. The GLM predicted a decrease of the suitable area for growing Norway spruce between 21% (B1, 2030) and 93% (A2, 2100) in comparison to 2000. This corresponds to a reduction in the potential area of Norway spruce from between 190,000 and 860,000ha. The financial effect of this reduction in area was then evaluated by using a classical Faustmann approach, namely the land expectation value (LEV) as an economic parameter for forests of Norway spruce versus European beech. Underlying cash flows were derived from a distance dependent, single-tree growth simulator (SILVA) based on data for prices and costs of the year 2004. With an interest rate of r =2%, the predicted loss in the potential area of Norway spruce is related to a decrease of the LEV between 690 million and 3.1 billion Euro. We discuss the sensitivity of these results to changing interest rates, risk levels, and rotation lengths. Results suggest that managing forestland for profitability will be increasingly difficult under both climate scenarios.  aPubAg article  cUSDA submission 3atimber management 3acosts and returns 3aspatial distribution 3aglobal warming 3asilvicultural practices 3adeciduous forests 3aconiferous forests 3aPicea abies 3arisk assessment 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest economics 3asimulation models 3aforest trees 3aequations 3aclimatic factors 3aFagus sylvatica 3aforest succession 3agrowth models 3astand management 3aGermany 0aforest rotation length 0aeconomic analysis1 aHummel, Susan1 aCullmann, Dominik A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Feb. 5, v.  259, no.  4 p.710-719dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas1 oproduct_pubag1 oislandora_article_repository1 oislandora_pubag_with_text1 o(Journal)jnl9013  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/382153Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.08.0213Available from publisher's Web site  aArticle  aJournal:jnl9013b0378-1127c259d4e710  fForest ecology and management  aissued  a20100125b20100205c00000000  aIND443136489ExL  aINDdLYNe2010/01/25  aNon-US  a2016-09-13  a20100125 20100205 00000000bIND LYN 2010/01/25  aUSDA/FS  aagid:38215  a2010-02-08  aConverted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.4 using MARC21slim2MODS3-4.xsl (Revision 1.95 2014/04/23)  a4313648
